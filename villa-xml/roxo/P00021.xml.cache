      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Steel, glass and timber form the ultramodern design of this slick four-bedroom villa overlooking the tranquil Natai Beach, just half an hour's drive north of Phuket airport.</p><p>Sleeping eight and laid out over three levels, Villa Roxo may be one of the cosier villas within the exclusive Sava Beach Villas estate, but it's also one of the most stylish. Contemporary artworks adorn the walls and its modern vibe is felt in everything from the state-of-the-art kitchen all the way to the rattan chairs and colourful textiles.  </p><p>A sparkling 18-metre pool runs down one side of the villa, flanked by a lush garden bed and a pool terrace with sun loungers offering ample opportunity for low-key lazing. Though separated from the sands of Natai by a single row of villas, this sleek, tropical escape has stunning beach views and a leafy outlook, with spacious, living and dining areas opening to the pool, a TV room on the lower floor, a barbecue station and a shaded outdoor dining area with ocean vistas.</p><p>Fully staffed, with a manager, private chef and housekeepers, plus a masseuse and babysitter on call at an additional cost, Villa Roxo is the perfect place to reset and recharge. Feast on Thai delicacies over lunch and then doze off mid-massage with nothing more than the sound of the waves lapping at the beach or mellow beats playing through the stereo system. Cocktails are, of course, optional. </p><p>Only moments from the glistening sands of Natai Beach, a peaceful strip of sand to the north of Phuket, this villa is ideal for small families or groups seeking seclusion and endless sunsets. Should you crave a change of scenery, a stroll down the beach or a short drive will bring you to a choice of local seafood restaurants and fine dining at the Iniala and Aleenta resorts. Roxo is next door to the estate’s well-equipped sea-view gym, available to guests on a complimentary basis. </p><p>Click on these links to find out more about seven-bedroomed <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-tievoli-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Tievoli">Villa Tievoli</a>, six-bedroomed <a target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Amarelo" href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-amarelo-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx">Villa Amarelo</a>, <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-cielo-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Cielo">Villa Cielo</a>, <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-essenza-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Essenza">Villa Essenza</a> and <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-malee-sai-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Malee Sai">Villa Malee Sai</a>, and four-bedroomed <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-aqua-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Aqua">Villa Aqua</a> to see how the <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas, Natai Beach">Sava Beach Villas</a> can be combined to meet your holiday requirements.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Roxo offers plenty to keep families and friends entertained without leaving the luxurious and spacious villa grounds, but the idyllic Phang Nga and northern Phuket area is worth exploring, with some of Thailand’s most breath-taking natural sights, excellent dining and leisure activities within easy reach. And for those in search of a bit more holiday variety, the shopping centres, bars, street markets and notable dining scene on Phuket island are just an hour’s drive away.</p><p>Here’s a selection of some of the places we’d recommend exploring beyond Villa Roxo: </p><ol><li>Unleash your inner Indiana Jones and cool down in a waterfall pool on a mini jungle trek at one of the nearby Phang Nga parks.</li><li>Discover the rich marine life and stunning white beaches of the Similan islands on a snorkelling or diving day trip (mid October to mid May only).</li><li>Bring your camera and explore the coastal roads of the Natai Beach area by bike. Cycle through lush rural landscapes among coconut and banana plantations.</li><li>Charter a luxury yacht or traditional longtail boat for a cruise around Phang Nga Bay and its dramatically steep limestone islands, and don’t miss the chance to do a sea kayak journey through the caves and dreamy hidden lagoons.</li><li>Embark on a gastronomic tour at the celebrated restaurants of nearby Iniala and Aleenta resorts, or try some of the low-key eateries serving authentic Thai fare on the Natai beachfront or in Kokkloy town.</li><li>Treat the family to a soak-and-slide adventure at Splash Jungle on Mai Khao Beach near Phuket airport, or Dino Sea Water Park, just eight kilometres away.</li><li>Take in the inspiring views over Phang Nga Bay with a visit to the stunning Samet Nangshe viewpoint, best seen at sunrise.</li><li>Golf fans can visit two of the area’s top courses in northern Phuket: the Blue Canyon Country Club (23km away) has two 18-hole courses set on 730 lush acres of former tin mine land, and Mission Hills Phuket Golf Club (29km) is an ocean-view Nicklaus Design course on the east coast.</li><li>For some wildlife encounters with an ethical edge, go to the Phuket Elephant Sanctuary, a refuge centre for elephants retired from the tourist trade, or stop by the Gibbon Rehabilitation Project near Bang Pae Waterfall, a rescue and release centre for abused primates and other animals.</li><li>Take a stroll around Phuket Town for its local food, chic cafés, arts and craft studios, street markets and wall murals, and soak up the colourful Old Town atmosphere of the restored Sino-Portuguese buildings and Chinese shrines.</li></ol>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Shush! Don’t tell anyone, but just a 30-minute drive to the north of Phuket airport is a 10-kilometre-long stretch of heavenly white sand. The pristine, near-deserted Natai Beach faces the shimmering waters of the Andaman Sea and is backed by a tranquil rural landscape where buffalo roam and farmers tend their land. It’s in this splendid tropical Thai setting that Villa Roxo brings holiday dreams to life.</p><p>Set just a few steps back from the beach, the vibrant, three-storey, four-bedroomed Villa Roxo embraces its tropical seaside setting with bright contemporary living space leading out to a large furnished sun terrace and an 18-metre infinity pool. At ground level is a cosy TV/entertainment room equipped with a foosball table and plenty of board games. The open-plan living, dining and kitchen lie on the villa’s middle floor, facing the pool, and the villa’s four bedrooms – two sea-view masters with ensuite bathrooms and two guest bedrooms with a shared bathroom – are all on the top floor. </p><p>Professionally trained staff take care of guests at Villa Roxo. The team includes a villa manager, villa attendants and a skilled Thai chef, all offering attentive personalised service.</p><p>Some of the many natural wonders to explore in the area include Phang Nga Bay, jungle-clad national parks and spectacular waterfalls, while some surprisingly fine dining can be found just minutes away at the Aleenta and Iniala resorts. Airport transfers and private car hire (with driver) can easily be arranged, giving you freedom to explore this beautiful part of Thailand.</p><p>If your holiday dream is to get away from it all, relax with family and friends moments from a beautiful beach, be looked after by caring staff and discover the delights of Thai cuisine, Villa Roxo is the place for you.</p>]]></Description>
