      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Saffron &amp; Blue had its name inspired from the coral-coloured sands of Thambapanni Beach and clear azure skies. True to its name, this 4 bedroom elite haven in Kosgoda, Bentota is a mixture of hues and flavors – a reflection of its owner’s exquisite taste and wealthy experience. Ranil de Silva, an Ad man founding Leo Burnett, Sri Lanka’s largest advertising agency, has successfully expressed his likes, his inspirations, his description of the places he has seen and his multi-faceted creativity through the personal handpicking of every single piece of furniture in his plush holiday home.&nbsp; This complemented the villa design of Channa Daswatte, a leading renowned Sri Lankan architect whose work extends to the sub-continent.&nbsp; He is a protégé of the late Geoffrey Bawa, the world-famous architect himself.</p><p>The villa boasts huge spaces, modern facilities, jacuzzi and outdoor pool, mezzanine area in the rooms and fine art collection. In-villa staff provides for every guest’s needs, from housekeeping services to special dietary requirements!</p><p>At Saffron &amp; Blue, food is very important.&nbsp; The resident chef and his assistant were personally trained by celebrity Chef Koluu. Planning meals is extremely thrilling knowing that an amazing chef is there to fix one’s cravings. Barbecue party? No problem! The villa has an outdoor barbecue facility that is enjoyable on a moonlit night, whole-day swimming in the beach or pool parties. Lunches and more formal dinners may be served from the dining room with a table that hosts up to 12 guests.&nbsp; The daily complimentary breakfast may be served from the semi-outdoor nook that features a cement table and wooden barstools.</p><p>Though utterly tempting to stay in the comfort of the villa confines, guests will find it delighting to visit the local markets selling all kinds of delicacies, spices and fresh produce. Experience turtle hatchery, wide beaches, beautiful bays and enchanting reefs of Kosgoda.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>In and around Kosgoda, there’s plenty to do culturally, historically and recreationally. A ten-minute walk from Saffron &amp; Blue brings you to a turtle hatchery – a must-see experience, particularly on a moonlit night. Eco boat rides through the mangroves, water skiing, antique hunting and temple explorations are some of the best-loved local offerings. While the historic town of Galle – with its charmingly restored boutique hotels, cobbled streets and glorious ramparts – is just an hour’s car journey away. And then there’s the beach, just a few footsteps from the villa.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Saffron &amp; Blue’s staff will have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bentota’s fine stretch of sand </span>is great for swimming from October to April, and with care at other times of year. The main beach has lifeguards, so look out for flags. The stretch to the south is prettier and quieter though not so good for swimming.</li><li>Visit Lunuganga, the magnificent 23-hectare estate of the late <span style="font-weight: bold;">architect Geoffrey Bawa</span>. Comprising a beautifully renovated old house, a number of gorgeously-positioned buildings and intertwining terraces designed to overlook the gardens and frame the views; this garden is a true inspiration. Tours are best followed by a delicious rice and curry lunch or high tea.</li><li>Learn all about Sri Lanka’s five species of endangered<span style="font-weight: bold;"> marine turtles</span> at the Kosgoda Sea Turtle Conservation Project, just along the beach from Saffron &amp; Blue. The project has been running since 1988 and its main aim is to monitor local sea turtle activity and conserve the local nesting sites. Hatchlings are released into the sea most evenings.</li><li>Wander through the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brief Gardens</span>. The estate of Bevis Bawa, brother of architect Geoffrey, boasts terraces, manicured lawns, borders of tropical blooms and hidden garden courtyards whilst the low-slung house is filled with interesting artwork, sculptures and personal photographs of Bevis posing with Hollywood movie stars.</li><li>Go windsurfing, surfing, waterskiing, wakeboarding, body boarding, banana boating, tube riding, jet-skiing and deep sea fishing with the Sunshine Watersports Centre, one of the most established <span style="font-weight: bold;">water sports</span> operators in Bentota. </li><li>Head to Bentota village and explore this rural inland hinterland by bicycle. You can visit a Buddhist temple and also stop off at Lunuganga for tea. Guided tours can be organised, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">hire a bike</span> and explore on your own.</li><li>The huge <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ariyapala and Sons Mask</span> museum in Ambalangoda, documents the history of kolam (folk) dances and sunni yakuma (healing) dances through interesting, well-laid out displays showing the evolution of each mask and their unique style. There’s a shop here too and you can see mask makers in action. </li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>One of the best-kept secrets of Sri Lanka’s west coast is the shimmering hamlet of Kosgoda, just south of Bentota. Naturally blessed with wide golden beaches, a beautiful bay, a small reef, and multiple estuaries flowing into an azure sea, these bejewelled surrounds were the colourful inspiration for the conception of Saffron &amp; Blue. This elegant and thoughtfully designed four-bedroom villa and its charming staff look forward to welcoming you.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Saffron &amp; Blue is the creation and holiday home of Ranil de Silva; an Ad man who has directed his creative energy into the project by painstakingly selecting the furniture, art, and everything in-between – to compliment the villa’s architecture and setting. This delightful four-bedroom villa in Sri Lanka is all about spaces and moods and places and hues, with a mix of bright, sunny areas and cool, secluded nooks and crannies. </p><p>Fabrics from Jim Thompson of Thailand are predominant, interspersed with sustainable handlooms from Sri Lanka’s very own Barbara Sansoni and specially sourced cactus silks from Morocco. Most of the furniture is of Sri Lankan origin and includes a collection of rare antiques, as well as many other bespoke pieces made from teak, mahogany and jack wood. The villa is also home to a tasteful gallery of art by known Sri Lankan artists, as well as lesser-known painters from India, Cambodia, China, Malaysia and Thailand. </p><p>You will be warmly looked after at Saffron &amp; Blue by Rajeewa and Kumudu, who pride themselves in making every guest feel as welcome as one of the owner’s closest friends.&nbsp; Along with chef Chamith, this charming duo take care of everything from serving meals and drinks throughout the day, to keeping the villa and grounds pristine, to organising cars or <span style="font-style: italic;">tuk-tuks</span> for sightseeing trips.</p><p>Arrive at sunset and enjoy the spectacle of the vibrant skies reflected in the swimming pool. Unwind with a pre-dinner drink, then sit down to a hearty meal. Play your favourite music, watch a movie, or simply gaze up at the stars. Next morning, enjoy a refreshing dip in the pool or a walk along the beach. Tuck into a traditional Sri Lankan breakfast of <span style="font-style: italic;">string hoppers </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">roti</span>, then spend the rest of the morning exploring the nearby village. Enjoy a late lunch of rice and curry like the locals, or simply settle for a sandwich or a bowl of pasta – followed by a mandatory siesta! Wake up and start all over again.</p><p>Everything at Saffron &amp; Blue reflects great taste. But at the end of the day, it’s the small, personal touches that make this home truly special – and the generosity of an owner who proclaims <span style="font-style: italic;">mi casa es tu casa</span>.</p>]]></Description>

Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is a real plus – and one that means parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday too. </p><p>With its open outlook, big garden and seaside setting, Saffron &amp; Blue is a great villa for families: those with toddlers will need to be vigilant, however, due to the villa’s open staircase and pool. That said, the friendly staff always make children feel as welcome their adult guests, and are happy to lend a hand. If mums and dads want a little break and some flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds, local nannies can be organised (with advance notice and for an additional charge). </p><p>Although the equipped kitchen allows you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will be happy to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with Brayan or Chamith and they will take care of the rest. Coconut roti by the pool for breakfast? Toasties for tea? No problem. Chamith can customise all meals to suit children’s taste buds. </p><p>And should the excitement of exploring the villa and its beautiful surrounds start to wear off, check out our <a href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html" target="_blank" title="Things to do">Things to do</a> page – there’s plenty in the area to keep all the family amused throughout the holiday.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Crossing Saffron &amp; Blue’s threshold, you come first to&nbsp; a tastefully furnished entrance courtyard with a reflecting pool where you can make your holiday wish and set afloat the tropical blooms presented to you upon arrival. This Sri Lankan styled courtyard is a peaceful spot to sit quietly and immerse yourself in that book you’ve been waiting to read, and the round table here is just the place for a game of cards or a board game later in the day. </p><p>At one end of the entrance pavilion is the breakfast bar, with outdoor and indoor sections.&nbsp; Relax here with your morning coffee and chat to the staff as they prepare your breakfast. </p><p>A stunning triple-height, open-fronted lounge forms the heart of Saffron &amp; Blue – a delightful indoor-outdoor space supported at the front by stout round pillars that echo the graceful coconut palms punctuating the gardens. A bold palette of grey, blue and yellow brings this room to life, while the freestanding staircase at one end is a sculpture in itself, conceptualised by the architect to complement the building’s simple architecture.&nbsp; This lounge is sparsely but stylishly furnished, with a large built-in day bed cushioned in bright blue centre-front, and a sitting area arranged below leading Sri-Lankan artist, Jagath Ravindra’s, tall and bold tryptic expression of ‘the awakening’.</p><p>At one end of the ground floor is an altogether different space – the intimate, low-ceilinged dining room, with its impressive square 12-seater table and views out to the gardens via tall windows, front and side. </p><p>A split level above, between the dining room and the master bedroom, is an elegant TV lounge furnished with a soft sofa and wicker-framed armchairs.&nbsp; Browns, oranges, ambers and creams create a warm ambiance in this comfortable room. These same autumnal colours are reflected in an eight-panel oil painting by contemporary Sri Lankan Artist Pramith Geekiyanage, which captures the power of man.</p><p>Within the villa’s privately walled and lushly planted gardens, to one end of the swimming pool, is a furnished terrace and a shady pool lounge with bench seating and a large built-in day bed – all topped with ‘saffron’ cushions.&nbsp; At the other end of the pool, sun loungers stretch out below a bright blue sunbrella.</p>]]></Description>
