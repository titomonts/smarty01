      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Birdsong greets you as you drift out of sleep; mynahs and bulbuls and flower peckers competing for air time. They love the tropical gardens at Villa Waimarie: the yellow and red ixora bushes, the red, pink or white hibiscus, the scarlet flame of the forest bushes and, towering above all, the majestic African tulip tree that drops goblet-size orange flowers on the lawns.</p><p>A winding brick path takes you through the lush gardens and then here it is: the peaceful water (“Waimarie” in the Maori language) of the Gulf of Siam and the almost deserted white sand of Lipa Noi Beach.</p><p>Sip your coffee in the large shady sala next to the pool of this heavenly Samui villa as you gaze out across the water. Close to the shore it’s pale green. Then comes a band of dark amethyst, giving way to aquamarine stretching to the horizon. Five islands pick up the morning sunlight and behind them the mountains of mainland Thailand form a blue-grey graph against the sky.</p><p>Villa Waimarie has six ensuite guest rooms, configured in three cottages, each with a connecting door so that families can stay … connected. </p><p>Close to the beach are the spacious dining pavilion and the lounge pavilion, with its huge sink-into sofas and armchairs.</p><p>The friendly staff – villa manager, chef, housemaids, gardeners and security guard – ensures every request is met efficiently, and always with a smile.</p><p>Families love this place. Nanny service can be provided and for older kids there is the villa’s own tennis court, along with two sea kayaks and two stand-up paddle boards and all the gear for beach volleyball. </p><p>Villa Waimarie is popular not only with families or groups of friends but also for weddings and other social or corporate events, accommodating up to 30 people seated (40 standing).</p><p>And every one of them feels special.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Koh Samui is not a big island – it’s just under 230 square kilometres, and much of that is still pristine forest-covered hillside – but it offers a wealth of fun and interesting things to do. Let your villa manager know what sort of activities you’re interested in and he or she will help guide your choices and can also arrange transport to take you there.</p><p>In the meantime, to whet your appetite, here are some suggestions. </p><ul><li>Dusit Deva <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural Centre</span> is a slightly eccentric garden filled with creatures from Buddhist and Hindu myths. Kids will love it.</li><li>Koh Samui has <span style="font-weight: bold;">two golf courses</span>; Santiburi (18 holes and really distracting ocean views), and Bophut Hills (nine holes).</li><li>Treat the family to Sunday Brunch by the pool at the internationally famed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nikki Beach Club</span>, just a few minutes away along the beach.</li><li>Visit nearby Nathon Walking Street <span style="font-weight: bold;">Night Market</span> on Thursdays or the bigger Fisherman’s Village Night Market in Bophut on Fridays.</li><li>Go <span style="font-weight: bold;">island hopping</span>! The Ang Thong National Marine Park encompasses a cluster of islands – the ones you can see from Tawantok Beach Villas. The heavily jungled islands are carefully controlled to keep them in pristine natural condition. A trip to them is a must.</li><li>There’s a <span style="font-weight: bold;">kite surfing</span> school on the beach at Nathon where you can rent a rig or learn how to do it.</li><li>Regular<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Thai boxing</span> tournaments are staged at the largest stadium on the island, the Petch Buncha near Chaweng. These are not tourist demo fights; they are the real thing.</li><li>Samui has a number of spectacular <span style="font-weight: bold;">waterfalls</span>. We would recommend starting with the Namuang Falls. Take your bathing costume; there’s a very inviting pool at the base of the falls.</li><li>Have an <span style="font-weight: bold;">adventure </span>atop Khao Pom mountain on ATVs or the zipline, or just gaze out at the scenery below from the viewpoint.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Waimarie is Maori for “peaceful water”, and the name is entirely apt for this villa where, for most of the year the sea is flat as glass and as warm as a mother’s hug. This is Lipa Noi Beach, and when you stay at Villa Waimarie you will have it almost to yourself.</p><p>The rooms at this glorious Samui villa are secluded in the tropical gardens where guests are woken each day with birdsong from the resident mynahs, sunbirds and bulbuls. As you meander along winding brick paths, inhale the scent of frangipani and delight in the colourful splashes of brilliant tropical flowers.</p><p>Then, as you walk through an elegant archway, the sea greets you. Drink in the view. The sand is white and powdery. Next to the shore the sea is pale green, giving way to a band of dark amethyst, then aquamarine stretching to the horizon. Islands reflect the morning sunlight and behind them the mountains of the Thai mainland form a blue-grey graph against the sky. </p><p>Between you and the sands of Lipa Noi Beach is the villa’s inviting pool. Next to it is the sprawling sala, a favourite place for guests to loll and recharge their batteries. Work? Never heard of it.</p><p>Ensuring that guests have every opportunity to appreciate the delights of Waimarie to the full, the efficient, smiling villa staff anticipate every whim. The chef, especially, will cater to any culinary caprice, with Thai or international favourites.</p><p>Between meals, perhaps have a lazy swim before refreshing your tan in a sun lounger by the pool or on the beach. Or order up a soothing massage.</p><p>Feeling more energetic? Give someone a good thrashing on Waimarie’s private tennis court or across the beach volleyball net, or take to the sea on one of the villa’s kayaks or paddleboards. Out into the peaceful water.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>You arrive at Waimarie through the main gate into the brick-paved courtyard and parking area, with the tennis court on the left. From there, a brick path leads through an elegant archway into the gardens and past the rooms, on left and right, and then to the main focus of the villa: the beachside pool with the huge sala to the left, lounge and entertainment room facing the ocean, dining and kitchen pavilion to the right. Just a couple of steps away is the beach itself.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The six bedrooms at Waimarie are arranged in pairs in three spacious bungalows. Each pair has a connecting door making the bungalows ideal for families, though these doors can, if required, be locked for privacy. Each air-conditioned room has a shady veranda with sofa and armchair. All six rooms have huge ensuite bathrooms with double vanities and a rain shower. Pride of place, however, goes to the elegant freestanding bathtubs, each set beneath a glass roof. Botticelli’s Venus would be delighted to emerge from such a shell.</p>]]></Description>

Facing the bed is a large <span style="font-style: italic;">chaise longue</span> with colourful cushions and, in a corner, an elegant teak desk and chair. These are rooms not only for sleeping but also, perhaps, for a nightcap and a quiet discussion about plans for the following day. Let’s sleep on that.</p> ]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>As befits its beachside tropical location, much of Waimarie’s indoor living is almost outdoors, with wide glass doors to the lounge and dining pavilions opening to allow the sea breezes and the view of the Gulf of Thailand to float into the interior.</p><p>The dining pavilion, attached to the kitchen, has a large square table that easily seats 12, as well as a spacious breakfast bar. There are four refrigerators, including a wine cooler, and a well equipped and stocked coffee station. One wall is taken over by a large replica of a bas-relief from Angkor Wat, showing a Hindu god and his court.</p><p>Close by, the lounge pavilion has huge sofas and armchairs to sink into. An impressive teakwood central divider splits the room into social/reading area and entertainment area. The latter has a generous wide-screen TV with satellite connection, DVD player, Apple TV 4K box, and iPod station. A high-end stereo connects to smart phones or other compatible players, to relay guests’ choice of music through the lounge and the neighbouring sala.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Here, too, the owners’ love of classic Asian art is in evidence, the back wall being home to two intricate wood carvings. </p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>A big favourite with Waimarie guests is the beachside sala. It’s huge: big enough for a long dining table with benches either side, and a massive L-shaped sofa and two armchairs looking out to sea. Fans in the vaulted ceiling keep the shady interior cool. This is the real social centre of the villa.</p><p>Some people like swimming in the sea; some prefer a pool. At Waimarie you’re spoiled for choice. The 15 -metre pool, partially shaded by a large banyan tree with twisted roots, is two steps away from the beach</p><p>The extensive gardens surrounding the rooms at Villa Waimarie are a tropical delight, with manicured lawns fringed with hedges of yellow and red ixora, and overhung with scarlet flame-of-the-forest bushes. Presiding over all are tall coconut palms and an African tulip tree, which carelessly drops huge orange booms onto the lawns below. Birds and butterflies flit constantly from one leafy nook to another. And kids will be thrilled to find a playground within the villa gardens. </p><p>For those who just can’t idle in the sun, the sea or the pool all day, the villa has a swing hanging over the beach, table tennis, and all the equipment you’ll need for a game of football or volleyball on the beach. If you prefer your activities wet and salty, there are two sea kayaks and two stand-up paddleboards. Pride of place in the list of activities goes to the private tennis court, which also has a basketball hoop in one corner. </p><p>And then there’s the beach. Lipa Noi Beach has to be one of the world’s most delightful yet least known tropical gems. Soft white sand with almost no one on it. Warm sea with islands in the distance. And at sunset, the perfect venue for a sundowner or two.</p>]]></Description>

At Waimarie you can pick and choose from a full menu of spa and beauty treatments administered by experts, in the privacy of your room, poolside or even on the beach. From a foot scrub to a facial, let yourself be pampered for few hours. </p><p>Here’s a few examples of what’s on the menu:</p><p>Thai massage is a widely recognised and admired art that sees the masseuse twisting and bending body, head and limbs in ways that might at first seem impossible. Follow this with a hot herbal compress and you’ll be as relaxed as a strand of <span style="font-style: italic;">al dente</span> spaghetti.</p><p>Or you can opt for a head and shoulders massage, or a reflexology foot massage. Add a touch of aromatic oil or aloe vera to make it even more exotic.</p><p>And finally, nails.
