	This is authentic Bali. To us, the real highlight was to get away from the crowds. The villa is only 20 to 30 minutes&rsquo; drive away from many of Bali&rsquo;s tourist hot spots, but is sufficiently remote to offer a totally relaxing experience. Do get out with the villa manager either for a walk or cycle around the paddies, this is beautiful rural Bali at its very, very best. The people are friendly, the scenery is stunning and the way of life should be a message to us all.</p>

	Rice fields, jungle and a thriving rural community. The villa is tucked away on one side of the lovely village of Nyambu. We recommend that you venture into the village and explore the surrounding roads, either by bicycle or on foot. Meeting the locals, seeing their wonderfully strong but simple lifestyle is one of the great pleasures of this villa. If you&rsquo;re tempted to explore further afield, use the car provided to take you for a round of golf at the Nirweana Bali Golf Club (12km) or temple sightseeing at Tanah Lot (15km); shopping or eating out in Seminyak (20km); walking or surfing at the beach (Seseh and Echo beaches are nearest at around 5km and 10km respectively). A day in Bali&rsquo;s cultural centre of Ubud (40km) is also highly recommended.</p>

	It is difficult to pinpoint what&rsquo;s best about The Arsana Estate. During our stay the chef cooked an exquisite dinner which was served fabulously by the staff. With the windows open, the sound of the waterfall and distant wildlife and a gentle breeze drifting in it was a delight. The so-cool pool leads off into the jungle, and with the Boss sound system cranked up, a G&amp;T in hand and a masseuse on call, what more could one ask?<br />
	<br />
	The staff were a pleasure &ndash; especially the villa manager &ndash; always attentive and smiling but nicely discreet. We could hardly believe it when the manager chased us on his motorbike for seven kilometres to return our laptop cable after we checked out. Such care! The bedrooms have superb views, &lsquo;top&rsquo; bathrooms and ever-so-comfortable beds: closing the blackout curtains led to a deeply enjoyable but totally unplanned lie in!<br />
	<br />
	Game of billards? DVD on the big screen? Walk in the village? There&rsquo;s so much to do and yet it&rsquo;s so easy to chill. To be honest there was no one thing that makes this villa shine, it all works really well and we could not recommend it enough.</p>
</ROverallComments>
    <RUnpleasantSurprise><p>
	Two things to note: first, the villa is tiered down a hillside and the steps will present a problem for families with very young children or those with mobility issues; second, the bedroom pavilions are quite separate from each other (have a look at some of the images) and the common areas are a little walk away from the sleeping areas. Many families have stayed here and had a ball however, so do not be too alarmed. The villa is in a tiny village where road repairs on not high on the agenda so be prepared for a bumpy last ten minutes of the journey: the stunning scenery more than makes up for it.</p>

    <ROverallComments>In our years of travel to Bali, we've come across many villas but none as special and memorable as Arsana. 

Service was impecable as was attitude. We were assisted with every need and felt overly pampered throughout our stay. For a villa 6 years of age, we must admit that it is very well maintained. We were impressed with the sprawling grounds, facilities and rooms. We had in our group two young children who enjoyed their stay and had fun each day tumbling on the trampoline, scoring goals at the small soccer pitch and floating on mini inflatables at the pool. 

We will be back for more fun times! </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>A huge thank you to Pak Dandi, Made and all of the staff for the most amazing stay at the Arsana Estate! We held our wedding at this villa (60 people cocktail style) and no words can describe how perfect of a setting it was, it was like something from a movie set! We were completely speechless when we first arrived and couldn't believe how gorgeous the estate was, and our guests were blown away as well. The level of service we experienced from all of the staff was 5 star, and the chef, Ketut, created some amazing feasts for us. I highly recommend the Arsana Estate not only for a wedding, but for a family holiday or reunion, staff workshop / team building event or a getaway with a group of friends. Thank you again for a wedding (and holiday) of a lifetime....we will be back!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Desi, Pande, Ketut and all the staff were fantastic.  This villa has got it all.  We felt like we were completely at home, and we're sad to leave.  In fact we barely left the villa.  Some difficulty in arriving with our previous hotel driver getting a bit lost and it took almost two hours on a crazily bumpy road, but the villa driver was amazing and there was a much much easier way to get in and out.  Food was excellent, and Ketut even gave us a cooking lesson one day.  We miss his satay, prawn and glass noodle salad, and peanut sauce, but he kindly shared his recipes with us and we will enjoy the memories when we cook them at home and try to replicate his dishes.  All the villa staff were amazing, and friendly, and were always on hand to get anything you need, without ever feeling intruded upon.  We lived poolside and with daily spa treatments from the visiting day spa ladies, we were in pure relaxation heaven.  Thanks so much for a wonderful two weeks in paradise.  Some minor maintenance issues with air conditioning remote controls in the main house not working so well, and the floorboards in the master suite and main house were in need of some repairs, the dining room setting was overdue for an upgrade, with the upholstery on its last legs.  But with some maintenance work, this place will not disappoint.  The tranquility was wonderful, and so nice to be away from the crowds of Seminyak, and even Ubud these days.  I definitely recommend this villa.  We had children for the first week, and the stairs can be a bit of an issue with younger children, or people with mobility problems.  But the staff are lovely and always helping out to entertain the little ones.  Our Second week was a group of friends, and we had an equally lovely time.  If you want to totally relax in a beautiful location, with separate private suites for everybody, with nobody else about, I highly recommend this villa.  Thanks Arsana.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>If you plan to have a relaxing holiday and away from the bustling town and noise of traffic, this is the perfect place to stay. Nature is abundant which surrounds the villa, giving you an immediate relaxing feeling but with the comforts of technology (for people who can't get away from work). </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>For a 7 year old villa, the upkeep is superb. Very often for hotels the published photos are miles away from the actual thing. This however was not the case. The team running in place was superb, tending to our every need. Special thanks to Adek and Desy. Highly recommended for a group with kids/teens as they will be fully entertained while you enjoy a massage or lounge by the pool.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Our group of 4 families with 7 children aged 5-15 enjoyed our 5-night stay over Easter. The facilities are fantastic - we loved the trampoline, the lawn with football goal, the sizeable pool, the amazing kids' bunk room which everyone wanted to sleep in, a huge media room with an impressive selection of DVDs, and the food especially the Mee Goreng, pisang goreng, kuih dadar, pancakes.  The villa staff looked after us well and helped us with arrangements within and outside the villa. The Arsana is well located for those also considering a visit to Ubud which is just 45 mins away. Otherwise there is plenty to do at the villa if you don't want to make the 45 minute journey into Seminyak. Overall a wonderful holiday for us, and I would enthusiastically recommend it to parties visiting with a group of children.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We had the pleasure of staying at the Arsana Estate for 5 nights 5-10June.  It was one of the most magical places I have stayed at.  The estate is so spacious. From the moment we arrived at the Villa, we were treated like royalty (and we were treated like this, right up until our waves goodbye).  All of the staff enjoy their jobs and it shows!  We travelled with 9 adults and a 3 year old and a 6 month old.  The staff were all very helpful with the children. Tia was amazing. Always offering to hold our little girl, whilst we we eating our meals. (Thank you). The meals were amazing (thanks chef). breakfast, lunch and dinner was prepared everyday at whatever time we requested to eat.  The whole estate was cleaned every morning before we woke and the pool area all set up with towels etc for the day.  On our 3rd day, was the most special day of our stay.  Our wedding day!  One we will remember forever!  I can't thank everyone enough for the effort and input to make our day so special!  All the staff worked so hard., from setting up tables, cleaning the grounds and the list goes on.  Our wedding dinner , prepared by Arsana was absolutely Divine!  After our dinner, we were surprised by a lovely gift. Balinese Dance show,  Thank you ever so much!  Amazing.  Each Villa on the estate was immaculate.  The bathrooms with the opening doors to the pond are so beautiful!  My little boy loved the trampoline and also loved fishing in the fishponds (thanks guys). I really look forward to coming back and staying at the Arsana Estate again. I wish we didn't have to leave. We can honestly say...........One of the best places we have stayed at....Thank you x</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Thank you so much for a great time here. We all loved it sooooooo much! The staff made the place magic, making so many yummy dishes for us and cleaning up our mess! A special mention to Made & Tia also to the cooks. When we came back to the Bali this place will be at the top of our list!!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Second time I come in this wonderful place. Nice renovation and people are always so welcoming and wonderful. The place is always so calm and relaxing. We greatly appreciated the surprise for Kenzo's birthday. The Balinese dance was magic. I will advise this place to all my friends and people who wish to make an unforgettable trip. Thank you very much. I'll come back soon.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We had a truly memorable 10 days here at Arsana. With such beautifully well maintained areas, it has been a delight to unwind and immerse ourselves in the local village and all the experiences staying in a village can provide. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so comfortable. The food was insurmountable! Sampai Jumpa.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Our three weeks stay at Arsana has been magical. We have been thoroughly spoilt with the services given by all the staff here. It’s never an effort for them and they have always worn a smile on their faces. Rai the Manager has been fantastic with the organization of all our needs. She seems to have a magic wand and makes it all happen. She has made Arsana a very special home. Ketut and Nengah are just excellent in the kitchen. Not only did the kitchen look professional but they both worked well in there and they were even willing to try to cook something that was new to them. We have really enjoyed our meals each time. The daily staff made it all perfect for us with their creativity - flower arrangements on the table, napkins folded differently every time. The Arsana home always looked immaculate and we really appreciated every little touch. Walking round the Estate, we also realized how hard the gardeners work to keep the garden looking so beautiful. We very much enjoyed the natural surroundings.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>As a food and travel blogger, I have enjoyed traveling around the world and staying in many amazing locations. The Arsana Estate is one of the best places I have stayed in. The service from Rai and all of the staff has been second to none. Always friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The meals were always tasty and delicious and the facilities on the property were first class. We can highly recommend Arsana to everyone.</ROverallComments>
