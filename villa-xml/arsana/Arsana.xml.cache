      <Description><![CDATA[<p>From the moment you weave your way past a grove of bamboo and descend the flight of frangipani-fringed steps, the Arsana Estate will have you in its thrall. The sheer amount of space! The ravishing beauty of the architecture! The spectacular setting!</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Arsana </span>is Sanskrit for ‘flowing’ – an apt name for this extraordinary two-hectare estate where a cascade of living and sleeping pavilions streams past lotus ponds and water walls down the terraced hillside towards the river rippling on the boundary. A destination in itself, this is a place where one can truly relax and be in the flow. No need to lift a finger here; the highly professional staff will work magic for you behind the scenes. Why even leave the estate when it includes everything you could think of to entertain and enchant?</p><p>Lounge by the 19-metre pool overlooking the river, or play pool in the games room. Work up a sweat in the gym or smash it on the tennis court. Enjoy a massage in the spa annexe or watch a movie in the home cinema on the 85-inch TV or drop-down projects screen. Preside over sparking conversation at the head of the five-metre dining table while the accomplished chef serves a gourmet meal. Then retire to one of the four spacious ensuite bedrooms and be lulled to sleep by the soothing sounds of nature.<br /></p><p>Everywhere, the design flair and attention to detail is phenomenal. Massive contemporary carpets mix with oriental rugs under a copper canopy of designer lamps. A sophisticated palette of warm greys and soft sand flows through textured linen, latticed teakwood and textured walls. Contemporary paintings complement antique Chinese ceramics, and heritage artefacts sit comfortably alongside hi-tech facilities. The British owner’s passion for Asia shows in carefully curated furniture too, such as burnished lacquerware chests and towering Chinoiserie chairs. Everything is built to the highest specification, with no expense spared.</p><p>South-west Bali’s famed black-sand surfing beaches and Canggu’s laid-back café and beach scene may only be a short drive away, and the bright lights of Seminyak reachable within half an hour; but you’re unlikely to want to leave this enchanting tropical paradise.<br /></p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The Arsana Estate occupies two hectares of glorious terraced hillside gardens bordered by a jungle-clad river in the quiet traditional village of Nyambu in the Tabanan Regency of Southwest Bali. Known as Bali’s ‘rice bowl’, this fertile area features rice fields unfurling to the horizon, where farmers follow the rhythms of their forefathers and our guests can witness village life little changed in generations. Bali’s iconic Tanah Lot sea temple and famed surfing beaches are just over 10 kilometres away, Canggu’s hip bars and cafés about the same distance, and the restaurants and boutiques of Seminyak around half an hour’s drive to the east.</p>]]></Description>
