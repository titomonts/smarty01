    <RHighlight>Few villas can possibly match Villa M for its abundance of appealing features – the pool, the entertainment terrace, the gym and spa room, the lavish bedrooms, the staff and the view. It’s also very close to one of Phuket’s least crowded yet prettiest beaches.&nbsp; And other delights of Phuket are not far away.&nbsp; Everything you need is no more than an hour from Villa M, and usually within 30 minutes.</RHighlight>

    <ROverallComments>Villa M underwent a million-dollar makeover just before our visit in 2017, and it was sparkling like brand new.&nbsp; And that’s a five-star down-to-the-tiniest-detail brand new.<br /><br />The villa is also in an absolutely stunning location, high up on a steep wooded hill, presiding over a 180-degree ocean view.&nbsp; Coming through the surprisingly modest front door, we were blown away by that view and its reflection in the infinity-edge pool.<br /><br />When we finally dragged ourselves away for a tour of the villa, we found that every door we opened led to more delights; one superbly designed room after another.&nbsp; All the rooms feature large modern art canvasses – most in bright colours.&nbsp; It’s almost as if the villa knows it has to do something pretty spectacular to compete with the view for your attention, and these amazing art pieces are it.<br /><br />Upstairs, the walls of Villa M are almost entirely of glass, so that indoor luxury and outdoor amazement merge.&nbsp; But even on the lower floor every room has that same breathtaking view.&nbsp; It’s really quite delightfully distracting.<br /><br />After chilled sundowners to accompany the evening’s heavenly spectacle and supper looking out at the green and white lights of the fishing boats, we decided to leave the delights of the entertainment room for another day and just relax in the super-comfortable living room.<br /><br />Making this all so much more luxurious were the amiable and generous-minded villa manager, her assistant and the chef, who ensured that we enjoyed royal treatment throughout our stay.<br /></ROverallComments>
    <RUnpleasantSurprise>The pool is stunning but lacks a safety fence so carers of young children will need to keep close watch.&nbsp; Also, the stairs between floors are steep and winding, which may not appeal to parents with small children or older people with bad knees.&nbsp; Although Nai Thon beach is nearby it’s a steep walk down and back up.&nbsp; Not to worry though; the villa manager can swiftly organise a lift to get you there and back.&nbsp; Why not make the day of it and ask the chef for a picnic basket?</RUnpleasantSurprise>

    <ROverallComments>Had a wonderful experience here. From the moment we walked in we were greeted by the amazing view and staff, we could not have asked for more. Our group was particularly impressed by the level of service provided by Pook, the chef and the team. Their ability to anticipate our needs and to accommodate us was better then at 5-star hotels we have stayed at. The whole group agreed, this is the best villa we have stayed at. The food prepared by the chef was amazing and better than any restaurant we ate at in the city. We preferred to stay home rather than eat out. Thank you so much. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>An experience incomparable to a stay in a hotel. Villa M is a second home with exceptional staff - not to mention the kitchen, beyond expectations. Thank you to the team. The next holiday will be in a villa rather than a hotel and will certainly be with Elite Havens.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Stunning view, we enjoyed our holiday here. They provided us with all we need including gym room, ping pong table as well as high quality sound system. We could not make any complaint
in particular their chef made such delicious Thai food. We will definitely come back in the near future. We loved the services here and the manager and staff are very nice and helpful.

    <ROverallComments>What an incredible villa! The views are stunning but it is the villa staff that have really made our trip so special. We've enjoy 3 nights here as a surprise holiday for my husband's 40th birthday. Friends joined from Hong Kong for the weekend and we live in Singapore, we couldn't have had a better time. Thank you so much to all of the staff for looking after us and our 2 little girls a 2 year old and 5 month old. We will definitely be back.
