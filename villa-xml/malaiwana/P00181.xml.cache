      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The entrance to Malaiwana Villa M is surprisingly modest. It certainly doesn’t prepare you for what lies beyond: the expansive living room with its wall of sliding glass doors and beyond that the huge pool. Walk to the edge of that and you can take in the full 180-degree jaw-dropping view of the sea and sky.</p><p>To your right, way below, are the powdery sands of Nai Thon Beach, one of Phuket’s prettiest yet quietest strands, ready to discover when you’ve accustomed yourself to the luxury of this stunning Phuket villa.</p><p>That might take a little while.</p><p>Every room at Villa M – the two spacious suites and three luxurious bedrooms, the entertainment room, the gym and spa, the living room and the dining/kitchen pavilion, look out on the same magnificent view </p><p>At sunset the view is at its most spectacular: the greens, pinks, scarlets, purples and oranges doubled by their reflections in the infinity-edge pool, then dwindling until you can raise your glass to toast the millions of stars that emerge from the deepening violet void.</p><p>Even during the day the view is compelling, constantly changing as the sun’s fiery chariot wheels across the dome of the sky, chased by occasional clouds that change the colours of the sea below, which is rippled by light breezes and arrowed by fishing boats and the occasional yacht.</p><p>Ensuring that guests have every opportunity to appreciate the delights of Malaiwana Villa M to the full, the efficient, smiling staff of five (three full time) anticipate every whim. The chef, especially, will cater to any culinary caprice, with Thai or international favourites.</p><p>Between meals, perhaps have a lazy swim before refreshing your tan on a sun lounger by the pool. Or order up a soothing massage in the villa’s spa room, or head for the superbly well-equipped gym. Choices, choices. And all of them good ones at Villa M.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Entering through the main gate of Villa M, you’ll find yourself at the social centre of the building, the living pavilion with its high vaulted ceiling. To the left is the master suite, with its private access to the pool while to the right is the dining pavilion and well-equipped guest kitchen. Both pavilions have walls of glass doors to let the outside in and emphasise the fabulous view. </p><p>Beyond the dining pavilion is the decadent entertainment terrace. Stone steps lead from there down to the lower level. Straight ahead is the spa room and the superb gym, while a corridor leads first to the entertainment room with its 65-inch TV. Beyond are three bedrooms and a second set of stairs leading back up to the pool level, and, at the end, the second bedroom suite.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>As befits its tropical location, much of Villa M’s indoor living is almost outdoors. Floor-to-ceiling folding glass doors in the lounge and dining pavilions, and the master suite, open to allow the sea breezes and the view of the Andaman Sea to float into the interior, stirred by fans as large as helicopter rotors (though completely silent) to keep it all cool.</p><p>The living room has enough large orange sink-into sofas for everyone, and glasses and plates can be perched on wooden occasional tables shaped whimsically like Champagne corks or, in one case, a 2m-long clothes peg (a reminder, perhaps, of all that work that’s been left behind). </p><p>One wall is completely taken up with a mosaic of an Asian woman supine against a backdrop of skyscrapers. This is just one of the many pieces of art in Villa M that surprise and delight when you can tear your eyes away from the view. Next to it is a large bar.</p><p>To the right of the living pavilion is the dining space under a similarly vaulted roof and huge fan, and with three sides of folding glass doors. A comfortable table invites 12 people to sit and break bread together. To the rear is the guest kitchen, with coffee maker, toaster, five-burner gas range, griddle, electric oven and large fridge. Looking into the kitchen is the breakfast bar with five seats.</p><p>Downstairs, the gym is equipped with enough machinery to exercise every muscle you knew you had plus some you didn’t, along with a punch bag and a pool table. (For additional fees, a personal trainer or a Muay Thai boxing coach can be booked – just ask the villa manager). </p><p>Just next door is the spa room, a little gem with windows that open to the sea breeze to ensure that your spa treatment is completely blissful. To reserve a therapist (for an additional fee) please contact the villa manager.</p><p>After dark, the entertainment room is a major attraction. Here, a 65-inch TV holds pride of place, connected to satellite/cable feed, CD/DVD player with DVD library, X-Box, Wii&nbsp; and PlayStation. All the entertainment a person could want.</p>]]></Description>

Four comfortable sunbeds lounge at the north end of the pool looking along the glassy expanse to a full-wall mosaic at the other end, depicting a woman swimming in a pool. Art imitating life.</p><p>Most of the villa is connected with a top-of-the-range wireless Sonos sound system, turning your iPhone or tablet into a high-fidelity sound system. </p><p>Also connected, of course, is the purpose built open-air entertainment terrace with its deep sofas and armchairs. </p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Any true sunset connoisseur will tell you that the best are over the ocean, where there are no obstructions to the display. Better yet, find a place high above the water, where the sea reflects and doubles the sun’s glory. That is a pretty exact description of Malaiwana Villa M, high on a steep hillside dominating Phuket’s delightful Nai Thon Beach. It’s not just at sunset that the view is compelling. Throughout the day, the sky, the wheeling of the sun, breezes that fan and scallop the water, and fishing boats arrowing the surface, create a never-ending and never-repeated pageant.</p><p>And this Phuket villa has so much more to offer besides. The enormous infinity-edge pool, for example, constantly draws the eye through its reflections of the blue above, so that diving into it feels like diving into the sky. Around the pool the spacious deck and sun loungers invite indolence with a book, a chilled drink or a snooze. After a work out in the villa’s superbly equipped gym, retire into the shade of the lounge with its sink-into sofas and whimsical giant clothes-peg and champagne-cork side tables. Conveniently, there’s a bar here too.</p><p>About the time the sun is at its sultry zenith, the villa’s excellent chef will serve lunch, a feast of all of your culinary whims made real. Congregate around the table in the dining/kitchen pavilion, where glass doors concertina open on three sides to make sure you never miss a moment of the ocean’s display. And after the sun has gone down, chill out under a billion stars on the vast, purpose built entertainment terrace. And then, finally, to bed in one of the villa’s five super-comfortable bedrooms, to dream of sea and stars. <br /></p><p>Phuket is an island full of delights but be warned: you may not get to see them. Villa M may just be all the holiday you can handle. <br /></p><p>Click on these links to find out more about four bedroom Malaiwana Residences - <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/malaiwana-residence-duplex-c2-villa/nai-thon-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Malaiwana Residences - Duplex, 4 bedroom villa">Duplex</a> and <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/malaiwana-residence-penthouse-c1-villa/nai-thon-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Malaiwana Residences - Penthouse, 4 bedroom villa">Penthouse</a> or the other villas in the estate: four bedroom <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/malaiwana-villa-rodnaya-villa/nai-thon-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Malaiwana Villa Rodnaya, 4 bedroom villa">Villa Rodnaya</a> and six bedroom <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/malaiwana-villa-haleana-villa/nai-thon-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Malaiwana Villa Haleana, five bedroom villa">Villa Haleana</a>.<br /></p>]]></Description>
