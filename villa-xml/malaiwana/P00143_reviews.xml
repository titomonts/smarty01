    <RHighlight>We nearly wept on leaving this fabulous haven and its awe-inspiring views to return to the real world.&nbsp; Nai Thon is one of our favourite Phuket beaches and this, combined with the delicious meals prepared by the chef and the caring service from the staff, left us feeling like well-pampered celebrities throughout our stay.<br /></RHighlight>

    <ROverallComments>Vivid tropical skies, fiery sunsets and crystal-blue seas … Nai Thon Beach is a truly idyllic place, and viewed from our private poolside within Malaiwana Duplex it looks even more spectacular.&nbsp; We quickly relaxed and eased into the cool, subtle interior of the Duplex, which forms a calming contrast to the colourful tropical surrounds.&nbsp; Though the Duplex is found within a three-unit, three-storey residence we enjoyed complete peace and privacy here and neither heard nor saw any of our neighbours.&nbsp; The 15-metre pool is gorgeous. <br /><br />The Duplex is the perfect place for what we call a full-spectrum holiday: enjoying five-star comfort and service while having the simple, natural pleasures of a tropical island at our doorstep.&nbsp; Having an early-morning swim in the pool, then a decadent breakfast served in style and total privacy on the terrace.&nbsp; Later on, a stroll along the sand and a snack of grilled chicken on a skewer from a beachside food vendor.&nbsp; Then back up to the Duplex in time for sunset cocktails and an elaborate dinner of rich Thai curries, spicy whole fish and stir-fried veggies, all planned the day before with our chef.&nbsp; Finally to bed, where the master suite offers a soft, sumptuous embrace and the promise of more fabulous sea views, just a curtain-peek away upon waking up tomorrow. <br /></ROverallComments>
    <RUnpleasantSurprise>Though the Duplex is enticingly close to Nai Thon Beach, the route is steep, so if walking is a challenge an estate buggy can be summoned.&nbsp; With no safety fence around the pool, families with toddlers will need to be vigilant.<br /></RUnpleasantSurprise>

    <ROverallComments>Thank you so much for warmth hospitality. It was a great pleasure staying here during my holiday. This villa looks very elegant and clear. I enjoys every moment staying here, enjoy the facilities, seeing the view. I would recommend visitors to come here and stay with their family and friends. Totally worth it! This villa and this location is suitable for those who prefer to stay quiet and peaceful. Not quite a place for party people who wants to enjoy might life and entertainment, as it is far from Patong Beach – an hour drive from here to there. Highly recommended! I will be back here again soon.
 
Your sincerely 
Myo Thiha"</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>What an extraordinary week! We've never had such a holiday before. From the first moment, every need was met. The food at every meal was amazing and "Jeng" our chef, was happy for us all to watch and learn. Our 10 month old baby "Ivy" had the time of her life with so many willing arms and playmates - the staff were all wonderful with her and she loved them. Thank you so much for such a well organized and relaxing holiday. Special thanks "Lilly" for co-coordinating everything.
