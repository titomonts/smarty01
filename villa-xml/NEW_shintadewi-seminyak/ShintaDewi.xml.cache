      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Your villa manager will have a wealth of information about places of  interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required.  Do ask the staff about the area too; most will live nearby and can give  an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of local  Bali life.</p> <p>In the meantime, here’s a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of Villa Shinta Dewi</p> <ol><li>Fashionistas, trendies and shop-a-holics should hot-foot it down  to&nbsp;<strong>Seminyak</strong>,  Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave. Here, you can indulge  for hours in  the glut of stylish, chic boutiques. There is a wide choice of  fine  dining, mid range, and cheap ‘n cheerful restaurants in Seminyak too:  fine  dining venues include Sarong, the famous Ku Dé Ta, Mama San, La  Lucciola, Petitenget, Merah  Putih, Sardine and Métis.</li><li>It’s  possible to walk the sands of Seminyak’s <strong>Petitenget  Beach</strong>  all the way to Kuta in the south, or north to Canggu. The beach is   more popular with locals than tourists (not safe for swimming in most   sections), but is a great spot for building sandcastles or to watch the  sunset  as you sip a cocktail from one of the many beachside bars. </li><li>Villa Shinta Dewi is close to the famous temple at&nbsp;<strong>Tanah Lot</strong>&nbsp;(16   km).  Visiting early in the morning (8-9am) provides a better  idea of the power of  the location and the chance to see it undisturbed  apart from perhaps an  offering ceremony.</li><li>Play a round at the well-laid out 18-hole <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Beach Golf Course</span> or go further afield to Kuta for the 85-hectare <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Kuta Golf</span> for a natural desert-like landscape and fantastic view.&nbsp; <br /></li><li>Drive westwards to explore the charming&nbsp;<strong>Tabanan regency</strong>,   revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains  and  black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north  to explore  the volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul,  including Lake Bratan  with its photogenic and stunningly positioned  Pura Ulun Danu – one of Bali’s  most important temples.</li><li>The most exclusive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali trekking tou</span>r promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of<a href=" http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title=" Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. "> Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. </a><br /></li><li><strong>Bali Treetop Adventure Park</strong>&nbsp;is near the  town of  Bedugal in northern central Bali (next to Lake Bratan). Five adventure   circuits, with heights ranging from two to 20 metres, challenge all  level and  ages on suspended bridges, spider nets, Tarzan jumps and 12  flying foxes.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart.
