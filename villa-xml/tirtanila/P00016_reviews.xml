    <ROverallComments><p>As soon as we walked into Villa Tirta Nila, we could feel the love that has been poured into it by its thoughtful and creative owners. The villa has a beautiful energy and much of that must be credited to the small team of helpful, friendly staff who are clearly very happy to be working there. We were warmly greeted by the manager, Gusti, and a very special mention must go to Sumi, the cook, whose dishes were delicious. From the villaâ€™s spectacular seafront setting and breath-taking views, to its seaside terrace and dining pavilion, clever architectural design, and its gorgeous, stylish interiors, eye-catching artwork and artefacts, beach-worn chic furnishings, comfy beds and sofas, immaculate bathrooms and kitchen, and a thoughtful array of books and board games, the provision of two bicycles, garden, pool, and sand-floored volleyball court, we loved it all.</p></ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>I wish I could give this villa 10 stars. The villa is amazing, the view, the ocean, the cleanliness - everything is exactly how it appear in picture. I want to review the villa for the staff mostly as Sumi, Gusti and Umon (our driver) were beyond hospitable. The service and attention that they offered us was second to none. Such amazing people. My Husband and I stayed here for our Honeymoon and we pick the best place. This Villa is amazing and well worth the cost. We will definitely be back.</ROverallComments>
