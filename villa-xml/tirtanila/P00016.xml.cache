      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Tirta Nila beach House is located within the quiet and natural environs of Mendira Beach in the tiny fishing village of Sengkidu, three kilometres from Candisasa on Bali’s east coast. There is very little in the immediate area apart from a series of small beaches, coconut groves and banana plantations, and a traditional village and temple. It is safe for swimming here and the reef immediately in front of the villa offers good snorkelling. One kilometre up the lane are several hotels with restaurants and bars and a small sandy beach, which is safe for swimming. There is a charming collection of restaurants and simple souvenir shops in Candidasa. <br /></p>]]></Description>

    <Content contentid="4321" contenttypeid="TTD" desc="Things To Do">
      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Your villa manager will typically have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any tour bookings for you. Do ask other members of staff about the local area too. Invariably some of them will live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.</p><p> In the meantime, here’s a taste of some of the activities on offer within reach of the villa:</p><ul><li>Twelve kilometres to the east of Candidasa, you will find the hidden <span style="font-weight: bold;">beach </span>of Pasir Putih, meaning ‘white sands.’ Fringed by a coconut grove and flanked by green headlands with a sheer cliff behind, you will feel like you have stepped back in time. The tranquil ambience, complete with the simple grass roofed eateries, is reminiscent of the Bali of the 1970s. </li><li>If you would like to witness the marine life under the ocean without having to get wet, take a ‘Voyage of Fantasy’ in the Odyssey <span style="font-weight: bold;">Submarine</span>. Accommodating 36 passengers with 2 pilots, the submarine will transport you on an unforgettable journey to a depth of 20 metres under the sea to explore the colourful coral reef. This is a great activity for families with young children.</li><li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">hiking </span>around Candidasa is superb, and the villa staff can arrange for a local guide to escort you. At Bukit Asah near the village of Bug Bug, a gentle two-kilometre walk brings you to a hilltop outlook blessed with a beautiful panorama of the sea, the coastline and neighbouring islands. Longer hikes will take you through forested land and rice terraces. Along the way you will see many Balinese farmers working in their fields, and you can explore local villages.</li><li>At the peaceful 700-year-old <span style="font-weight: bold;">walled village of Tenganan</span>, the residents practice a time-honoured lifestyle based around ritual and ceremony. Many of the houses function as shops and workshops where expert craftsmen and women perform their centuries’ old skills. Traditional ‘ata’ vine baskets are laid out in neat rows upon the ground, and artists display their lontar carved books. Inside the workshop homes, you can see and purchase the famous, highly valued double ikat textiles. The women will demonstrate the weaving process using small looms.&nbsp; </li><li>The picturesque <span style="font-weight: bold;">water palace of Taman Ujung</span> was built in 1919 by the last Raja of Karangasem. Resting in the vast pool is a series of intriguing, romantic pavilions linked by bridges, archways, and a shaded avenue of mango and frangipani trees. </li><li>Also built by the water-loving Raja is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tirta Gangga</span>, a fabled maze of spine-tinglingy cold bathing pools and basins, spouts, tiered pagoda fountains, stone carvings and lush gardens showcasing a blend of Chinese and Balinese architecture.&nbsp; </li><li>Many of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">restaurants </span>in Candidasa offer a free pick-up and drop-off transport service, including the wonderful <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vincent’s</span>, where you can relish romantic dining in a gorgeous garden, high quality international cuisine, superb service, cool and colourful artwork and lazy jazz music. <span style="font-weight: bold;">La Rouge</span> is another charming restaurant. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Asli</span> is a restaurant and cooking school, near Amlapura. It is one of the island’s best, serving traditional Balinese food created from home-grown ingredients and cooked in an authentic Balinese-style kitchen on wood-fired, mud brick stoves, which allow the real flavours of Bali to shine. </li><li>At the village of Jasri, visit the Sorga <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chocolate Factory</span>, where you can observe the entire chocolate-making process from the cacao fruit to the delicious organic chocolate bars and truffles.&nbsp; A tasting session is a must.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>The picturesque, natural harbour and village of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Padangbai</span> is the departure and arrival point for the car-ferries and fast boats to and from Lombok. Head up the hill above the car-ferry dock and you’ll find Bias Tugel Beach aka Pantai Kecil (the little beach, also known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Secret Beach)</span>, complete with a number of <span style="font-weight: bold;">beachside warungs</span> serving food and drinks. Accessing this gorgeous patch of paradise involves scrambling down a cliff path.</li></ul><ol></ol>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Tirta Nila Beach House, our gorgeous holiday home situated right beside the sea in the village of Candidasa on Bali's picturesque east coast. Our four-bedroom villa is a world away from the traffic jams, crowded beaches and frenetic nightlife of the tourist hubs of south Bali. Here, we offer you a very different, peaceful alternative in a part of the island less touched by modernity. Tirta Nila is perfect if you’re seeking privacy, or if you want to take life at your own leisurely pace. It’s also a great choice if you are looking to have a relaxing family holiday. </p><p>You can also look forward to being pampered by our treasured team of staff. Their genuine enthusiasm and warmth is charming and unpretentious. Attentive to your every need, they are quietly efficient but never intrusive, and we think you’ll be amazed by the seriously delicious home-cooked meals that come out of the kitchen. </p><p>We have lovingly decorated our beach house with aquamarine-ocean-themed paintings and cushions, timeworn turquoise furnishings and – we hope you’ll agree – some creative splashes of imagination. We know you will enjoy the private swimming pool, your very own elevated beach with direct access to the sea, and our beautifully manicured gardens dotted with water features. Play volleyball in the soft golden sand; snorkel in the clear waters of the sheltered lagoon immediately in front of the property; or relax poolside, where you will be cooled by gentle sea breezes. Furthermore, you will have the opportunity to explore a whole new side of Bali, from the cultural wonders of ancient villages, to the natural beauty of the rice terraces, mountains, valleys and beaches. </p><p>Once you have stayed at Tirta Nila Beach House it’s possible you may never want to stay anywhere else!</p>]]></Description>

The villa also has a barbecue on site. </p><p>Grocery shopping will be done by the staff at local markets and supermarkets. All groceries and beverages are charged at market price (plus a 20% handling fee which is subject to service and tax at the prevailing rate). Guests will be requested to provide grocery money in advance, and the staff will keep receipts for reference. To give staff time to shop, it is a good idea to plan meals the evening before.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Our team of friendly staff at Tirta Nila will make youngsters feel as welcome as adults, they are very happy to assist with children during the daytime when parents are present, and having these willing helpers on hand will give you the flexibility to do your own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost). </p><p>Although this is a great villa for families, toddlers will need to be carefully supervised around the swimming pool and seafront areas. Kids will love the lawn and the man-made sandy beach, which is set up for volleyball. If it happens to be a rainy day, the villa is well equipped with an abundance of children’s DVDs, books, board games and toys, while the media room provides extra space for kids to hangout. At low tide, older kids will enjoy snorkelling in the clear waters of the lagoon directly in front of the villa. </p><p>Our fully-equipped kitchen allows you to prepare meals for fussy young eaters or babies with ease, but the staff will also be very happy to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or the cooks and they will take care of the rest. </p><p>Don’t worry about packing all that cumbersome kids’ equipment for your stay. Just let us know what you need, and anything we don’t have in-house (villa facilities include a baby cot, baby bath facility and highchair) can be hired on your behalf (click here to see list of available hire items).</p><p>And when the excitement of exploring the villa starts to wear off, check out our <a target="_blank" title="Things to do" href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html">Things to do</a> page; there’s plenty in the area to keep the whole family well amused throughout the holiday.</p>]]></Description>
