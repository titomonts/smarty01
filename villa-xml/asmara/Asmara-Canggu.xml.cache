      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Your villa manager, Nyoman, will have a wealth of information about places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the area too. Most will live nearby and can give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of local Bali life.</p><p>In the meantime, here’s a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of Villa Asmara.</p><ul><li>The villa is close to the famous sea temple at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tanah Lot</span> (9km). Although renowned for its sunset vistas, going early in the morning provides a better idea of the power of the location and the chance to see it undisturbed, apart from perhaps an offering ceremony.</li><li>A nice sunset alternative is to head down to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Echo Beach</span> (11km) where a number of cafés offer good sunset views and cold beer. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hotel Tugu</span>, a very stylish and eclectic boutique hotel a few minutes further down the coast is also a good sunset spot. Note that the beach along this section of the coast is dark volcanic sand and the waters are better suited to surfing than swimming.</li><li>Fashionistas, trendies shop-a-holics and foodies should hot-foot it down to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Seminyak</span>, Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave. Here, you can indulge for hours in the glut of stylish, chic boutiques and international restaurants and bars including, Potato Head Beach club, La Lucciola and Bali’s infamously trendy Ku Dé Ta. For furniture, antiques and homeware stores go for a wander around the streets of nearby <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kerobokan</span>.</li><li>Drive westwards to explore the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan Regency</span>, revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the <span style="font-weight: bold;">volcanic lakes</span> near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu – one of Bali’s most important temples.</li><li>Get up to some monkey business at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Treetop Adventure Park</span> (next to Lake Bratan). Five adventure circuits, with heights ranging from two to 20 metres, challenge all level and ages on suspended bridges, spider nets, tarzan jumps and 12 flying foxes.</li><li>Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and rural villages by <span style="font-weight: bold;">bicycle</span>; a great way to get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali. Stop off at a local warung (café) to sample some basic Balinese fare or cool off with a cold drink.</li><li>With its warm seas, almost year-round season, relatively uncrowded beach and reef breaks and suitability for all levels of experience, Bali surfing is world renowned. The beaches of Canggu (11km) are known for their <span style="font-weight: bold;">world-class surf breaks</span>, offering exposed reef breaks with consistent surf. May to October (dry season) is the favoured time for waves.</li><li>If you are a bold and brave bargain hunter, a spree within the heart of Bali’s bustling provincial capital is an exciting and rewarding experience. Visit the vibrant <span style="font-weight: bold;">Denpasar markets</span>, where everything and anything is available.</li><li>The most exclusive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali trekking tour</span> promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href="http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title="Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise.">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise.</a></li><li>Pulau Dive Charters offers <span style="font-weight: bold;">luxury boat charters</span> around the beautiful islands and waters surrounding Bali. They specialise in private fishing, surfing and diving charters and also offer unique personalised day trips to Nusa Lembongan. Perfect for a family day out on the water or with a group of friends.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>
 Villa Asmara is situated about 100m away from the sea on Bali&rsquo;s south-west coast, just beyond the sleepy village of Cemagi. The glistening black volcanic-sand shores and rocky outcrops are also home to the small, but picturesque sea temple of Pura Gede Luhur Batungaus. While strong currents make the water here unsuitable for swimming, there are plenty of rock pools to explore and seaside walks to be had.<br />
 <br />
 This is the perfect environment to take a stroll or bike ride through the surrounding rice fields and experience the traditional Balinese way of life; you are bound to witness a village ceremony or two as you explore.<br />
 <br />
 Despite its rural setting, the villa is only 30 minutes&rsquo; drive from the many restaurants and shops of cosmopolitan Seminyak. World famous Echo Beach is also within easy reach (10 minutes by car), where guests can enjoy the laidback surfer vibe, an ice-cold beer and some incredible sunsets.</p>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> The energy and ambiance of Villa Asmara is evident from the moment guests enter the compound through the traditional Balinese doors and cross the Palimanan stepping stones over the tranquil fish pond. From here, the living pavilion overlooks the 17-metre green-stone swimming pool, at one end of which a large carved stone Buddha evokes a deep sense of calm.<br /> <br /> The three-storey living pavilion comprises a lounge and dining room at ground level, games room and master bedroom on the first floor, and a media room cosily housed under the soaring eaves of the roof space. A second master suite occupies a stand-alone poolside pavilion, opposite which lie the two guest bedrooms.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> The focus of attention by the 17-metre green-stone swimming pool is undoubtedly the large Buddha-head statue that quietly contemplates the immaculately manicured lawns surrounding it. Here guests can absorb Asmara’s peace and tranquillity by putting their feet up on the reclining sun loungers, perhaps after a game of tennis on the villa’s shared court.<br /> <br /> The gardens are just heavenly: frangipani and palm trees sway in the breeze, while red dragonflies dart amongst the vibrant heliconias and fish meander through the waters of the tranquil pond.</p>]]></Description>
