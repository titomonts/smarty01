      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Staying at Villa Zelie in Canggu puts guests at the centre of Bali’s happening beach scene. There is good food and fun in all directions, and ocean waves are just a two-minute walk away.</p><p>The quiet residential street where Villa Zelie is located dead-ends onto a pedestrian-only path to Kayu Putih beach, better known as the site of La Laguna – a beachfront restaurant and bar with gypsy-fairy-tale character. Also on this stretch of golden sand are Finn’s Beach Club, Rip Curl School of Surf and casual beach shacks selling cold drinks and snacks. </p><p>Canggu, a couple of kilometres north-west of the villa, has the newest crop of hipster cafés, yoga studios, boutique stores and ritzy restaurants on the island. And everything here is woven into a beautiful patchwork of rice paddy terraces and private homes. To the south-east of Villa Zelie is Seminyak, with its own established offering of beachfront pool haunts, high-end shopping and much of Bali’s best fine dining and swankiest nightclubs. </p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Zelie is a private Eden exuding heritage chic. Moments from the beach, with La Laguna and Finn’s Beach Club an easy walk away, the villa is perfectly placed between Seminyak and Canggu, Bali’s hotspots for wining, dining and shopping. </p><p>Differentiating Villa Zelie from other Canggu villas are its style, scale and beachside location. Beautiful teak and ironwood buildings, inspired by traditional Javanese <span style="font-style: italic;">joglo </span>pavilions and <span style="font-style: italic;">gladak </span>houses are embellished with handcrafted furniture and treasures selected by the villa’s owner, a well-known Parisian designer. Four open-air living pavilions and five luxurious bedrooms mingle around a 20-metre swimming pool in the expansive terraced garden. Air-conditioned bedrooms are dreamy with canopy beds, spacious Bali-style outdoor bathrooms and verandas perfect for morning coffee and a quiet read. </p><p>Villa Zelie’s landscaped garden spans 3,300 square metres across four terraced lawns. Koi ponds frame the entrance and lotus ponds with tall <span style="font-style: italic;">padi padi</span> grass glisten below tidy walkways at the foot of the garden. Stone steps and paths are studded with lights that twinkle like a reflection of the stars from dusk until dawn. </p><p>A comfortable tropical ambiance prevails throughout the magical timber-framed living and sleeping pavilions, and guests are lulled into total relaxation with the attentive care of a villa manager, chef and butlers who will cater to every need.</p><p>Villa Zelie is ideally set up for families and groups of friends to socialise around the stunning swimming pool, share family-style meals, or watch movies projected onto the big drop-down screen. But equally there are plenty of peaceful private places to retire to when a little privacy is preferred. Older children and teens will love the independence of walking along the quiet residential street to the beach, less than 150-metres away. </p><p>This well-maintained paradise lends itself as a venue for intimate events, and weddings for up to 40 guests can be arranged with prior notice. </p><p>Villa Zelie is a work of art and a truly exceptional place to stay.</p>]]></Description>

Massage therapists and babysitters are on call.&nbsp; The helpful villa manager doubles as a local guide, arranging airport transfers, trips to nearby restaurants and attractions, as well as island tours with a private car and driver.</p><p>While Villa Zelie is tucked away in a quiet pocket of Canggu, it’s also mere minutes from beach clubs, shops and acclaimed restaurants, as well as being conveniently connected to the rest of Bali.&nbsp; The one thing that Villa Zelie is far from is ordinary.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa holidays overflow with family friendly advantages.&nbsp; Among them is having access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want.&nbsp; The whole family will be captivated by Villa Zelie. While kids revel in having free reign of the grounds, the villa’s privacy and security will give parents peace of mind. &nbsp; The 20-metre swimming pool at the heart of the villa is sure to be the focus of fun for older kids, and a shallow area to the side is ideal for toddlers and babies.&nbsp; When it’s time to seek shelter from the sun, enjoy some family fun playing board games in the entertainment pavilion, which also has a projector screen.&nbsp; Even watching movies at Villa Zelie is a unique experience.</p><p>Kids can join in family-style dining and the chef will be happy to modify the spiciness of dishes to suit their taste buds.&nbsp; Alternatively, you are free to use the kitchen as you would at home or simply let the chef in on “how mum makes it” to keep your brood happy.&nbsp;  Zelie’s staff are wonderful with kids and will make them feel very welcome, while full-time babysitters can be organised with advance notice, should mums and dads fancy some kid-free time beyond the villa.</p><p>Two additional beds (extra charges apply) can be set up either in the parents’ suites or in one of the guest suites - transforming it into a slumber party dorm.&nbsp; High chairs and baby cots are available, as well as other children’s items, so you can travel without the burden of bulky kids’ equipment (click <a href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> to see list of available hire items to request ahead).</p><p>When the novelty of exploring the villa grounds wears off, the Canggu neighbourhood offers a great choice of kid-friendly restaurants and family attractions.&nbsp; And then there’s the beach, just a few moments’ walk away.&nbsp; The sea can be pretty wild along the Canggu coast, so be careful to swim only between the yellow flags of the lifeguarded areas.&nbsp; Finns and Potato Head beach clubs are both within a couple of kilometres of Villa Zelie, offering more beachside fun.&nbsp; For more suggestions, see our <a href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html" target="_self">Things to do</a> page – there’s plenty in the area to keep the whole family entertained throughout your holiday.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>A two-storey building in the style of a traditional <span style="font-style: italic;">lumbung </span>(rice barn) makes a dreamy spot for a massage at Villa Zelie.&nbsp; Professional therapists carry out spa and beauty treatments in the open-air downstairs area with its canopy of white linen or in the total privacy of the quaint attic-like upstairs.&nbsp; In the latter, choose between air-conditioning or a sea breeze (you can see the ocean from the bay window) and a soundtrack of rhythmic ocean waves or your choice of music.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can ask for massage beds to be set up in your room, or at the poolside.&nbsp; Before you sink into deep relaxation, ask staff to prepare a flower petal bath in your suite to extend the indulgence.</p>  <p>See your villa manager for a full spa menu and to request appointments (extra charges apply).&nbsp; Here is a sample of what to expect:</p>]]></Description>
