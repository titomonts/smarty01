    <RHighlight><p>Villa Zelie provides a true feast for the senses; the wonderful feeling of solid teak under foot, soaking in a stone bathtub surrounded by candles, dining like royalty at the banquet table (not to mention being treated like royalty by the staff). Being surrounded by so much beauty was a privilege.</p></RHighlight>

	Once a sleepy fishing village, Berawa is slowly coming to life and makes an ideal choice for those wishing to escape the Seminyak crowds. The beach is easily reached at the end of the lane, and Berawa and Batubelig beaches are both within a few hundred meters. Echo Beach (5km) with its surfing action and string of lively bars and restaurants is also worth a visit. Desa Seni, a boutique health and wellness resort is 300m from the villa and offers a good range of yoga classes and a great restaurant serving up fruit and veggies direct from the garden. Canggu Plaza (1km) offers Italian, Japanese and Brazilian food, while neighbouring Canggu Deli has a good choice of western food and the Canggu Club offers a range sports facilities. A little further down the road Bungalow, and Butter Cafe (1.5km) both offer great coffee and lovely home-stye cakes and pastries while Warung Canggu provides good value Indonesian food. A short drive brings you to Petitenget (2km) and Seminyak (3km) with a plethora of dining and shopping options.</p>

    <ROverallComments><p>We are no strangers to beautiful villas, but Villa Zelie is definitely one of our favourites, and we were happy to forget the real world as we immersed ourselves in this enchanted cocoon of sumptuous comfort and superlative service.</p><p>In these days of modern minimalism we relished the chance to bask in pure, unabashed old-world glory. Every glance and every turn was greeted with a slice of Indonesian history; from the delicate floral motifs hand-carved on wood, to tribal shell-encrusted neck pieces fastening back drapes, nightstands adorned with feather headdresses and corners filled with stone statues. And it wasn’t just the quality of the antiques, but also their thoughtful placement and display, which made it abundantly clear that the owner has impeccable taste and style.</p><p>The use of natural woods and stone accentuated by richly hued textiles in the bedrooms creates warmth and cosiness – despite the generous size of the property, and our bedroom <em>gladak</em> felt like something straight out of a fairy tale. Ensuite bathrooms were wonderfully atmospheric with vanities carved into stone and petrified wood, and pretty courtyard gardens. Fabulous lighting throughout the property added an enchanting allure to evenings, when all was blissfully quiet but for the faint hum of cicadas and the distant sound of the waves,</p><p>The pool was absolutely stunning, long enough for swimming lengths, and perfectly situated in the middle of the property to soak up 360-degree panoramas of the ornate buildings framed by elegant travellers palms and a deep blue sky.</p><p>Zelie is more than just a villa; it’s an experience – and one that we never wanted to end!</p></ROverallComments>
    <RUnpleasantSurprise><p>We are clutching at straws here as we absolutely loved this villa, but we did note that only the master bedroom has TV, although with the cinema screen in the lounge and so much natural beauty around us, watching TV in bed was the last thing on our minds.</p></RUnpleasantSurprise>

    <ROverallComments>Thank you for making our 10 year wedding anniversary so exceptionally magical. We all had such a wonderful time with you. Our beds were so comfortable and we loved soaking in the bathtubs.
All the children loved swimming in the pool, with all different levels to jump off. Your family and entrance room became the perfect areas to play games, cards, draw and fill our world cup stickers balls. Movie night was also always a family favorite. Thank you to the exceptional warm, friendly and very responsive team.

    <ROverallComments>We spent six days at Villa Zelie. We had big expectations before coming here and I must admit that it was even better. The unique charm of the property, the staff well prepared and always attentive. Next to the beach and perfectly situated. We are able to do everything we planned. Thank you for making our stay delightful - from service, the food, the appetizers and the constant care.

    <ROverallComments>Villa Zelie is Amazing.  Each side of the villa is well decorated, clean, and well maintained. The bed is super comfortable and each rooms are spacious. The garden is well maintained. You will really feel the serenity at this villa. It's just so beautiful. The whole team is so welcoming, they are very attentive to all our needs and always give us big smiles. Thank you too to our Chef who made us a delicious omelette this morning. Thank you team for taking good care of us, we have enjoyed our stay so much. Villa Zelie, this place is haven made in Bali.

    <ROverallComments>Sincere thanks for making our 17 days stay here so welcoming and enjoyable. With our three children it was important to have a villa where the kids would roam, swim, play and chill out. Our two sets of family friends had just as much fun as we did. However, they only got half the time. We were absolutely blown away by the constant service, attentiveness and genuine care from Putu and Tapa. The food cooked by Made was consistently good. Our favorites were the steamed banana leaf fish and prawn curry. We are very appreciative of the efforts by the entire team.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We came to Villa Zelie to celebrate my 60th birthday, our 30th wedding anniversary and my recovery from cancer. We flew all of our children here and joined together for a week of fun relaxation and family time. It has been wonderful. Everyone here has been so kind and hospitable and made our week so special.</ROverallComments>
