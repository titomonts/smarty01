      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Natai is a beautiful beach of soft golden sands that sweep up the Andaman coast for 10 kilometers. The beach lies within Phang Nga province, just across the bridge from Phuket Island,. Strict building laws have limited development in the area, and only a handful of luxury villas and small upscale resorts are sprinkled along the beachfront. Inland, a quiet rural landscape remains intact with lush coconut groves and green fields where water buffalo roam. The nearest town of Kokkloy has a few banks and shops, but for shopping and nightlife, it’s best to take a drive to Phuket. Beyond the villa, find some excellent upscale dining spots at nearby beachfront resorts, while some of Thailand’s most enchanting sights are easily reached, including Phang Nga Bay and the Similan islands.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Though Villa Nandana’s ample comforts offer a complete holiday escape, there are many sights and activities in the vicinity that offer tempting reasons to explore beyond the villa. The natural wonders of Phang Nga are breathtaking, while Phuket Island offers myriad nightlife, shopping and cultural attractions. </p><p>Here are just a few ideas for things to see and do:&nbsp; <br /></p><ul><li>Natai Beach has attracted some luxury resorts to its shores, making it a new destination for fine dining and sunset cocktails. The restaurants at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Iniala and Aleenta resorts</span> have both earned acclaim, while<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Baba Beach Club</span> is a lively place with tasty Thai and Japanese menus, DJ nights and a swim-up bar. </li><li>Venture into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">jungles of Phang Nga</span> with its scenic waterfall parks, river rafting adventures and ATV rides. Or rise before dawn to visit <span style="font-weight: bold;">Samet Nangshe viewpoint</span> in time to catch the spectacular sunrise views over Phang Nga Bay.</li><li>After enjoying a bird’s eye view of it, hire a yacht or long-tail boat and explore <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phang Nga Bay</span> and its dramatically steep limestone islands and floating village. Or navigate by sea kayak for a paddle through hidden lagoons and caves. </li><li>Discover Thailand’s exotic wildlife with a visit to some of the animal rescue centres in the area. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phuket Elephant Sanctuary</span> in northern Phuket lets visitors observe elephants in their natural habitat, while at the nearby <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gibbon Rehabilitation Project</span>, rescued gibbons can be seen at rest and swinging around their large enclosures at the edge of Khao Phra Thaeo national park.</li><li>With dazzling white sands and crystal-clear waters, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Similan Islands</span> are known to be a top diving and snorkeling destination. Join a day trip or hire a private yacht to explore this vibrant marine wonderland. Note that the Similans are open to visitors from 15 October to 15 May only. </li><li>The history behind the restored Sino-Portuguese boutique shops and cafes in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phuket’s Old Town</span> is as colourful as the pastel-toned exteriors. Join a walking tour to learn more about the island’s culture, or simply wander around the Old Town area to shop, eat and soak up the lively street scenes. The walls of several buildings have also been splashed with large eye-catching murals.&nbsp; </li><li>For those who are keen to recreate the flavours of Thai cuisine in their own kitchens, a visit to Phuket offers an ideal time to learn with a real Thai chef! Thai<span style="font-weight: bold;"> cookery classes</span> are available at nearby Aleenta resort, the JW Marriott Phuket resort on Mai Khao Beach and The Slate hotel at Nai Yang Beach, with some courses including a visit to a local market.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Golf </span>enthusiasts will find some challenging courses to try just a short drive away from the villa. The Tab Lamu Thai Navy course is the nearest place to play, while Mission Hills Phuket Golf Club and Blue Canyon Country Club are found over the bridge in northern Phuket. Be sure to book tee-off times early in the morning before the tropical heat sets in for the day. </li><li>While the Andaman Sea offers endless aquatic adventures, some fun alternatives can be found inland. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Splash Jungle water park</span> near Mai Khao Beach offers water slide thrills and a wave pool, while wakeboarding lessons and rentals on a lake are available at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anthem Wake Park</span>. And for some indoor wall climbing challenges, visit <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rebel Rock Climbing</span> just next door to Anthem – a good rainy-day activity.</li><li>Spend a few hours hunting<br /> for souvenirs and more in Phuket’s many <span style="font-weight: bold;">shopping centres and markets</span>. In Patong Beach, find some bargains in the lively street markets or wander in air-conditioned comfort in Jungceylon mall. Phuket Town offers plenty of places to shop including the busy Naka Weekend Market, Lard Yai Sunday street market in the Old Town and Central Festival mall.&nbsp; </li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Staying in a luxury villa offers the ideal holiday escape for families, with a swimming pool, living areas and entertainment choices available for their exclusive use, and the freedom to relax, dine and play in privacy. Villa Nandana, with its enviable beachfront location, is especially well suited for families who wish to spend some quality time together in the great outdoors. </p><p>The 20-metre pool is sure to provide endless hours of joy for guests of all ages, with the soft sands of Natai just a few steps away for sandcastle building and dips in the sea. The large living room and TV room offer cool and comfy spots to retreat from the sun, while each of the spacious bedrooms is equipped with a TV, so no need for battles over the remote control! </p><p>Families are certain to savour mealtimes at Villa Nandana, too. Whether the kids are excited to try new foods or are the pickiest of eaters, the chef will be pleased to customise dishes to help whet their appetites. Such delicious child-friendly Thai dishes as <span style="font-style: italic;">gai haw bai toey</span> (deep-fried chicken wrapped in pandan leaf), <span style="font-style: italic;">satay gai </span>(grilled chicken on skewers) or <span style="font-style: italic;">pad thai</span> (fried noodles) might even coax the most unadventurous diners to have a taste.&nbsp; </p><p>We understand that travel can be cumbersome for families with young children, so a high chair and baby cot are provided free of charge. We can also help arrange hire of other items from reputable local agencies, as well as organise babysitters should mums and dads fancy a night out on the town (extra fees apply).</p><p>Beyond the villa, there are plenty of sights and activities for families to enjoy. See our Things to Do page for a few ideas, most of which are family-friendly, and be sure to contact your villa manager should you want help booking transport and tours.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>]]></Description>
