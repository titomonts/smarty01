      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The view is almost too much to bear.&nbsp; Almost, but yet not.&nbsp; The sky a deep solid, tangible blue overhead, with not a cloud, fading to a slight mistiness near the horizon, which is punctured by razor-edged islands that rise black against the light.&nbsp; The Sea picks up the colours, twists them into turquoise, indigo and cobalt, then flings them back up towards the Sun, which presides over all in its sultry magnificence.</p><p>The Sea.&nbsp; That’s the meaning, in the ancient Sanskrit language, of Akuvara, this delightful jewel of a villa next to Haad Lipa Noi, Samui’s prettiest yet quietest beach – a stretch of near-white sand edged with straight-soaring coconut palms and gently whispering casuarina trees.</p><p>Akuvara is not as grand as some other villas in the area, not as show-off.&nbsp; Its scale is more compact, more friendly, you might say; more approachable, more livable.&nbsp; For a family or a small group of friends this Samui villa, with its 13 x 5-metre infinity-view pool, is the perfect tropical beachside getaway.</p><p>Its architecture is simple, modern and uncluttered, with whole walls consisting entirely of glass to take full advantage of that glorious sea view.</p><p>Modern it may be, but the lovingly kept garden and the sand-coloured pathways that lead through it blend the whole calmly into the landscape.&nbsp; Friendly statues dot the lawns that separate the four bedroom pavilions, and ten-times-lifesize, whimsically colourful <span style="font-style: italic;">tokay</span> gecko bas-reliefs climb the walls to surprise and delight the unwary.</p><p>Akuvara is not all about lazing in the sun, of course.&nbsp; There’s a kayak for the more adventurous to explore the Sea, and games of pool, beach football or beach volleyball are all easy to organise.&nbsp; And that’s not forgetting the many delights of Samui Island that lie within easy reach by car.&nbsp; Nowhere is far.</p><p>As the sun leaves its throne and slides down the canopy of the sky, the colours change to the brilliant oranges, pinks, reds and greens of a spectacular tropical sunset.&nbsp; It’s probably time for sundowners overlooking the sea.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Akuvara is Sanskrit for ‘The Sea’, a simple but entirely apt name for a villa that lounges right next to the Gulf of Siam, a huge bay that is, for much of the year, as flat as glass and as blue as a lover’s smiling eyes.&nbsp; Between the large pool and the sea is Lipa Noi Beach, white and almost deserted.&nbsp; Stretch.&nbsp; Relax.&nbsp; Breathe.&nbsp; This is your home for now.</p><p>This Samui villa has been designed with self-indulgent indolence in mind.&nbsp; Just take a look at the spacious <span style="font-style: italic;">sala</span> right next to the pool and beach, equipped with two large loungers that invite a snooze, a quiet chat, a good book or simply an invitation to gaze at the sparkling cobalt sea.</p><p>If lazing on the beach under the sultry tropical sun gets a little too warm, the pool and the sea compete for your attention.&nbsp; Decisions, decisions... Life’s tough here.</p><p>As the sun slides down towards the horizon, dropping behind the silhouettes of the Five Islands, the nightly spectacle begins, with the blazing reds, purples, pinks and greens of the tropical sunset that reluctantly but inevitably give way to the deep violet of the night as billions of stars come out, seemingly just for you.</p><p>It’s an event that’s worth celebrating – every night – with a glass or two, perhaps, before Akuvara’s chef presents your dinner.&nbsp; A feast not just for the taste buds but for all the senses.</p><p>You don’t have to be indolent for your entire stay at Akuvara, though you can be – just waft a hand in the air and the staff, who seem to know what you want before you do, will take care of every whim.&nbsp; But if energy levels start to build up, jump into the villa’s kayak for a paddle out to sea, or take on the others at a game of beach football or volleyball.</p><p>And once you’re worn out, the villa’s supremely comfortable beds will carry you off into a night of deep bliss.</p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>An ancient traditional art, this method of massage was originally administered on temple grounds by masters with healing abilities.&nbsp; By exerting pressure on specific points of the body and by manipulating muscles and ligaments, the spine is elongated and relieved of tension.&nbsp; The sense of well-being as energy and flexibility are brought back into your body is extraordinary.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Koh Samui is not a big island – it’s just under 230 square kilometres, and much of that is still pristine forest-covered hillside – but it offers a wealth of fun and interesting things to do. Let your villa manager know what sort of activities you’re interested in and he or she will help guide your choices and can also arrange transport to take you there.</p><p>In the meantime, to whet your appetite, here are some suggestions. </p><ul><li>Dusit Deva <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural Centre</span> is a slightly eccentric garden filled with creatures from Buddhist and Hindu myths. Kids will love it.</li><li>Koh Samui has <span style="font-weight: bold;">two golf courses</span>; Santiburi (18 holes and really distracting ocean views), and Bophut Hills (nine holes).</li><li>Treat the family to Sunday Brunch by the pool at the internationally famed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nikki Beach Club</span>, just a few minutes away along the beach.</li><li>Visit nearby Nathon Walking Street <span style="font-weight: bold;">Night Market</span> on Thursdays or the bigger Fisherman’s Village Night Market in Bophut on Fridays.</li><li>Go <span style="font-weight: bold;">island hopping</span>! The Ang Thong National Marine Park encompasses a cluster of islands – the ones you can see from Akuvara . The heavily jungled islands are carefully controlled to keep them in pristine natural condition. A trip to them is a must.</li><li>There’s a <span style="font-weight: bold;">kite surfing</span> school on the beach at Nathon where you can rent a rig or learn how to do it.</li><li>Regular<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Thai boxing</span> tournaments are staged at the largest stadium on the island, the Petch Buncha near Chaweng. These are not tourist demo fights; they are the real thing.</li><li>Samui has a number of spectacular <span style="font-weight: bold;">waterfalls</span>. We would recommend starting with the Namuang Falls. Take your bathing costume; there’s a very inviting pool at the base of the falls.</li><li>Have an <span style="font-weight: bold;">adventure </span>atop Khao Pom mountain on ATVs or the zipline, or just gaze out at the scenery below from the viewpoint.</li></ul>]]></Description>
