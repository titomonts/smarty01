This air-conditioned area houses the modern guest kitchen, dining area and a living room with a stylish big black leather sofa facing an elaborate home theatre system with surround sound. Ceiling fans allow the room to be fully opened to the terrace, welcoming in the cooling sea breezes. White, black and grey tones give the guest kitchen a minimalist chic look, while its breakfast bar adds a convivial flavour. The kitchen is well equipped with modern appliances, though these are not likely to be used much with the villa chef ably handling all the cooking in the staff kitchen just behind. The eight-seater dining table is an inviting gathering spot set in the centre of the room.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Located within the Yamu Hills estate near Cape Yamu, Villa Music offer’s a fabulous bird’s eye view over Phuket’s lush east coast landscape and Phang Nga Bay – be sure to rise early to catch the colourful tropical sunrises. Yamu Hills is a small secured estate with a handful of luxury villas hidden away on the hillside. The villa’s location is quiet, yet it’s just off the main road leading to all the sights of the east coast area including the jungly Bangpae Waterfall and gibbon shelter, Mission Hills golf course, Phuket Elephant Sanctuary and local piers where boats depart regularly to Phang Nga Bay and idyllic islands nearby. Dine on excellent Thai and seafood at Peang Prai restaurant near the waterfall, or go for a rustic meal with a sea view at Bangpae Seafood, both within a five-minute drive of the villa. Breeze restaurant at the tip of Cape Yamu (5km) offers lavish Sunday brunches and exotic cocktails to enjoy with sunset views.</p>]]></Description>
