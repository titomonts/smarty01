      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Set on the hillside in Cape Yamu on the peaceful east coast of Phuket, Villa Sapna is a stylish five-bedroom haven with outstanding sea views in two directions. Wake up to a dramatic sunrise over Phang Nga Bay, then at dusk gather on the rooftop terrace to watch the sunset over Sapam Bay.</p><p>Relax, enjoy the views and settle in for a luxurious tropical holiday at this bright modern villa, which is arranged in two pavilions accented with exquisite works of art. The chic yet comfortable open-plan living and dining room and a generous-sized family room open fully to the 20-metre private pool, terrace, lawn and gardens.<br /></p><p>Swimming in the sparkling infinity pool, with its spectacular sea and sky vistas, offers a “floating in heaven” sensation, and the villa’s textured white walls, reflecting pools and orchid-filled urns lend an air of cool serenity. Inside are designer furnishings and eye-catching paintings by some of Asia’s most celebrated contemporary artists including Attasit Pokpong and Yue Min Jun. The five bedrooms, which include a poolside master suite with a jacuzzi, are each lavish hideaways with ensuite bathrooms, double beds and inspiring sea views.</p><p>Villa Sapna is part of a private estate in Cape Yamu surrounded by a rural landscape of coconut, banana and pineapple plantations and fishing villages, and offers the perfect base for exploring nearby tropical islands and Phuket’s lush interior. A five-minute walk down the hill leads to a small beach and pier used mostly by local fishermen setting off for the day in their longtail boats. Beyond the villa, Phuket’s best dining, spas, golf courses and west-coast beaches are all found within a 30-minute drive. </p><p>Guests enjoy the dedicated service of a private chef who specialises in Thai cuisine, a villa manager and housekeeping staff, all professionally trained to offer five-star care.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Cape Yamu is a lush headland on the eastern edge of Phuket that juts between Phang Nga Bay and Sapam Bay. Villa Sapna is one of 18 villas in the secured estate, The Bay at Yamu, but its position offers complete privacy and unfettered views. Just a five-minute walk down the hill is a beachfront promenade and small pier that leads to a local village with a few local food shops and an open-air seafood restaurant. The pier is a launching point for trips to nearby islands and kayaks and speedboats are available for hire. A jog or stroll around here in the evening is especially scenic when calm Sapam Bay turns crimson at sunset. Though the surrounding area is largely rural and rustic, nearby Breeze restaurant offers a fine dining experience and a popular Sunday brunch.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Sapna is in a prime area for discovering Phuket’s quieter east coast landscapes and the spectacular islands of Phang Nga Bay. Though the villa enjoys a more secluded location, a 30-minute drive or less will take you to well-known beaches, restaurants, golf courses, parks and other attractions. Be sure to ask the villa staff for their insider tips, and have a look at the recommendations below for just a few ideas on things to see and do beyond the villa:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Phang Nga Bay</span>, which is in full view from the villa, is a magical place to explore with its towering karst islands and calm glassy waters. Charter a cruise aboard a luxury yacht or join a sea kayaking tour and paddle through caves into hidden Garden of Eden lagoons.</li><li>Visit nearby Breeze restaurant for a decadent <span style="font-weight: bold;">Long Lazy Sunday Brunch</span> with fresh seasonal dishes. Bring along your friends or make some new ones as you dine, family style, at one long table seating 40 food-lovers. </li><li>Soak up the colourful Sino-Portuguese scene with a stroll around <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phuket’s historic Old Town</span>, where many century-old buildings have been restored and transformed into stylish cafes and boutiques. Every Sunday the lively Lard Yai street market opens along Thalang Road with a good array of local food, art and handicrafts for sale.</li><li>Go for an active family outing to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anthem Wake Park</span>, a multi-sport centre with an indoor climbing wall, cable wakeboarding and an inflatable aqua park on a scenic lake. </li><li>Indulge in some all-sensory rejuvenation at a Phuket <span style="font-weight: bold;">luxury spa</span>. Try treatments such as deep tissue massage, body scrubs and facials at the COMO Shambhala Retreat at Point Yamu resort, or book a full day spa package at the Banyan Tree Spa for a truly royal treatment. </li><li>Learn to make some of your favourite Thai dishes by joining a <span style="font-weight: bold;">cookery course</span> offered by the talented chefs at the nearby Nahmyaa restaurant in Como Point Yamu resort, or try a class with the master of Thai fusion, Chef Tammasak “Noi” Chootong, who has opened a new branch of his celebrated Suay restaurant in nearby Cherng Talay. </li><li>Find out more about local efforts to rescue endangered animals by booking a tour of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phuket Elephant Sanctuary</span> to watch rescued elephants at play in their natural environment, or on a visit to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gibbon Rehabilitation Project</span> just inside the entrance to Khao Phra Thaeo national park and Bang Pae waterfall. </li><li>Try a r<span style="font-weight: bold;">ound of golf</span> at one of Phuket’s meticulously landscaped courses including Mission Hills, Laguna Phuket Golf Club and Blue Canyon Country Club.&nbsp; </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Explore Yao Noi</span>, a stunning island just a short boat ride away in Phang Nga Bay that retains a traditional way of life. Cycle down narrow roads past buffalo fields and rice paddies, have a picnic lunch on a remote beach reached by long-tail boat and learn more about the local sustainable farming methods on a day trip. </li><li>Discover the exotic marine life of the Andaman Sea on a <span style="font-weight: bold;">scuba diving or snorkelling</span> day trip to nearby islands including Koh Khai, the Similan islands, Koh Phi Phi and the Raya islands. </li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>With its exquisite coastal setting on Cape Yamu offering both sunrise and sunset views, Villa Sapna is a luxury holiday escape like no other. Its modern, bright interiors with vivid works of art and designer furnishings open fully to a large outdoor area with a 20-metre pool, sundeck and tropical gardens with a surrounding panorama of brilliant blue sea and sky. </p><p>A close-to-nature feel is captivatingly contrasted by <span style="font-style: italic;">avant-garde</span> accents throughout the villa, especially in the living and dining area that brims with whimsy and colour.&nbsp; Faces are a strong feature in this room with a luscious-lipped portrait of a woman by Thai artist Attasit Pokpong and two smiling self-portraits by Chinese artist Yue Min Jun on display.&nbsp; The large family room, with its two sitting areas and a study opens completely to the pool terrace.&nbsp; Enjoy a workout with a view in the private gym, or gather to watch the sunset from the rooftop terrace.&nbsp; Each bedroom offers fabulous sea views, and a large sunken jacuzzi is among the added flourishes of luxury in the poolside master suite.</p><p>The villa has a big modern kitchen, but with a skilful chef available for every meal, guests are unlikely to spend much time here. Private dining is just one element of the five-star experience at Villa Sapna: a villa manager is on hand to ensure that every guest need is met, and a housekeeper attends daily to keep the villa pristine.&nbsp; The villa’s extraordinary sea-view setting also offers a dreamy backdrop for a wedding or event for up to 40 guests. </p><p>Cape Yamu is home to a few luxury villa estates but the area is mostly given to a rural landscape of forested hills and plantations of rubber, banana and pineapple.&nbsp; Sapam Bay is a five-minute walk away from the villa, its calm waters shimmering gold at sunset.&nbsp; Phang Nga Bay beckons to the east, with limestone islands to explore by chartering a boat at the nearby pier or east coast marinas.&nbsp; Though the villa’s location feels blissfully secluded, many good dining choices, shopping centres, spas, golf courses and swimming beaches are within a half hour’s drive. </p>]]></Description>
