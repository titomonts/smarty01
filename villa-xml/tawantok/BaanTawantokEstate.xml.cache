      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Soft white sand, the caress of the sun, warm, glittering blue sea dotted with islands, two opulent infinity-edge pools and two stunning villas from which to enjoy it all.</p><p>What more could a person want? Ah, tropical sunsets? Tawantok Beach Villas on Lipa Noi Beach, Koh Samui, have those, too. In fact, that’s what <span style="font-style: italic;">tawantok </span>means – “sunset”.</p><p>These two wonderful Samui villas – adjacent mirror-image twins – evoke the era, not long ago, when all homes in Thailand, no matter how grand, were built in timber, and craftsmanship was at a zenith. </p><p>All rooms, from the stunning master suites to the lounge and dining pavilions, sit beneath traditionally elegant Thai roofs. Most of the walls are glass, opening to the garden and letting in the astonishing ocean view.</p><p>Together, the villas offer 10 bedrooms – two master suites with mezzanine bedrooms above (making ideal family suites), and behind them eight guest rooms.&nbsp; With extra beds, up to 28 guests can be comfortably accommodated.</p><p>The living-and-dining areas, with their large rustic tables and sink-into-a-reverie sofas, are centres for relaxed socialising. And if you prefer open air tropical lounging and dining, there are two spacious salas next to the sea.</p><p>The staff – villa manager, chef, housekeepers, gardeners and security guard – seem to know what you want before you even realise you want it.</p><p>For more energetic guests, the villas share a beautifully maintained tennis court, and are equipped with kayaks, stand-up paddle boards, beach volleyball and goals for beach football.</p><p>The villas are perfect for families, with children of all ages catered for. They are also ideal for events such as intimate weddings, or birthday parties with friends.</p><p>Then there’s the rest of Samui to explore – if you can ever tear yourself away from these delightful Lipa Noi villas.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Tawantok Beach Villas comprises twin mirror-image villas set alongside the peaceful, powder-soft, white sands of Lipa Noi Beach on Koh Samui’s mellow west coast. Connected via a gate between their private, palm-fringed gardens, the two villas have a total of 10 bedrooms, including two magnificent master suites, sleeping up to 28 guests. Luxurious living and dining space, bedrooms and breezy beachside salas are housed in individual pavilions with distinctive Thai-style peaked roofs.

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Tawantok is Thai for “sunset”, a totally apt name for this west-facing Koh Samui retreat. Looking out across the lawn and pools, the main rooms have huge glass doors that open to let the sunshine and tropical breezes in.</p><p>Just beyond the pools is the talcum-soft white sand of Lipa Noi Beach, arguably one of Samui’s and possibly Thailand’s most beautiful yet quietest beaches. Beyond that, one’s gaze is drawn to the warm, sapphire-blue sea and the indigo silhouettes of islands on the horizon, the perfect setting for each evening’s sunset spectacular.</p><p>Ensuring that guests have every opportunity to appreciate the delights of Tawantok Beach Villas to the full, the staff seem to be equipped with emotion sensors that tell them what you want before you yourself know.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The chef caters to your every culinary whimsy with a delicious selection of Thai and international dishes. Indeed, his skills are such that many guests never feel the need to go beyond Tawantok Beach Villas to eat. Between meals, choose to lounge in or around the pool, play a game of tennis on the villas’ superbly maintained court, or order up a masseuse to iron out any kinks in your body or psyche. Or, of course, you can take full advantage of the beach and ocean. Enjoy a book under the shade of a palm tree, or a gentle surf on one of the villas’ stand-up paddleboards.</p><p>The possibilities are many and all of them deeply tempting. Welcome to Tawantok Beach Villas.</p>]]></Description>

When you’ve topped up on relaxation and feel the need for some activity – perhaps to make room for your next Thai feast – head over to the private tennis court to the rear of the villa compound for a game or two. And then there’s the beach. Lipa Noi Beach is a delightful yet little-known gem. Soft white sand with almost no one on it. Shallow, calm water that’s perfect for the kids. And at sunset, the perfect venue for a sundowner or two.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Koh Samui is not a big island – it’s just under 230 square kilometres, and much of that is still pristine forest-covered hillside – but it offers a wealth of fun and interesting things to do. Let your villa manager know what sort of activities you’re interested in and he or she will help guide your choices and can also arrange transport to take you there.</p><p>In the meantime, to whet your appetite, here are some suggestions. </p><ul><li>Dusit Deva <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural Centre</span> is a slightly eccentric garden filled with creatures from Buddhist and Hindu myths. Kids will love it.</li><li>Koh Samui has <span style="font-weight: bold;">two golf courses</span>; Santiburi (18 holes and really distracting ocean views), and Bophut Hills (nine holes).</li><li>Treat the family to Sunday Brunch by the pool at the internationally famed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nikki Beach Club</span>, just a few minutes away along the beach.</li><li>Visit nearby Nathon Walking Street <span style="font-weight: bold;">Night Market</span> on Thursdays or the bigger Fisherman’s Village Night Market in Bophut on Fridays.</li><li>Go <span style="font-weight: bold;">island hopping</span>! The Ang Thong National Marine Park encompasses a cluster of islands – the ones you can see from Tawantok Beach Villas. The heavily jungled islands are carefully controlled to keep them in pristine natural condition. A trip to them is a must.</li><li>There’s a <span style="font-weight: bold;">kite surfing</span> school on the beach at Nathon where you can rent a rig or learn how to do it.</li><li>Regular <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thai boxing</span> tournaments are staged at the largest stadium on the island, the Petch Buncha near Chaweng. These are not tourist demo fights; they are the real thing.</li><li>Samui has a number of spectacular <span style="font-weight: bold;">waterfalls</span>. We would recommend starting with the Namuang Falls. Take your bathing costume; there’s a very inviting pool at the base of the falls.</li><li>Have an <span style="font-weight: bold;">adventure </span>atop Khao Pom mountain on ATVs or the zipline, or just gaze out at the scenery below from the viewpoint.</li></ul>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>Thai massage is a widely recognised and admired art that sees the masseuse twisting and bending body, head and limbs in ways that might at first seem impossible. Follow this with a hot herbal compress and you’ll be as relaxed as a strand of al dente spaghetti.</p><p>Or you can opt for a head and shoulders massage, or a reflexology foot massage. Add a touch of aromatic oil or aloe vera to make it even more exotic.</p> ]]></Description>
