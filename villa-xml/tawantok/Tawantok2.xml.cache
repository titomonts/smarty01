      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Soft white sand, the caress of the sun, warm, glittering blue sea dotted with islands, an opulent infinity-edge pool and a stunning villa from which to enjoy it all.</p><p>What more could a person want? Ah, tropical sunsets? Tawantok Beach Villa 2 on Lipa Noi Beach, Koh Samui, has those, too. In fact, that’s what tawantok means – “sunset”.</p><p>This wonderful Samui villa evokes the era, not long ago, when all homes in Thailand, no matter how grand, were built in timber, and craftsmanship was at a zenith. </p><p>Every room, from the stunning master suite to the lounge and dining pavilion, sits under a traditionally elegant Thai roof. The walls are mostly glass, opening up to the garden and letting in the astonishing ocean view.</p><p>The villa has five bedrooms – the master suite and mezzanine room (an ideal family suite), plus four guest rooms. With extra beds, up to 14 guests can be comfortably accommodated.</p><p>On the other side of the garden is the living and dining area, with its large rustic table for communal dining and its sink-into-a-reverie sofas. And perfectly placed at one end of the pool, just steps from the sand, is a dining sala that’s always a favourite spot with guests. <br /></p><p>The staff – villa manager, chef, housekeepers, gardeners and security guard – seem to know what you want before you realise you want it.</p><p>For more energetic guests, the villa has a beautifully maintained tennis court, a kayak and stand-up paddleboard, a beach volleyball net and goals for beach football.</p><p>Families love the villa, with children of all ages catered for. It’s also a fine venue for events such as intimate weddings, or birthday parties with friends.</p><p>And then, of course, there’s the rest of Samui to explore – if you can ever tear yourself away from this delightful Lipa Noi villa. </p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Koh Samui is not a big island – it’s just under 230 square kilometres, and much of that is still pristine forest-covered hillside – but it offers a wealth of fun and interesting things to do. Let your villa manager know what sort of activities you’re interested in and he or she will help guide your choices and can also arrange transport to take you there.</p><p>In the meantime, to whet your appetite, here are some suggestions. </p><ul><li>Dusit Deva <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural Centre</span> is a slightly eccentric garden filled with creatures from Buddhist and Hindu myths. Kids will love it.</li><li>Koh Samui has <span style="font-weight: bold;">two golf courses</span>; Santiburi (18 holes and really distracting ocean views), and Bophut Hills (nine holes).</li><li>Treat the family to Sunday Brunch by the pool at the internationally famed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nikki Beach Club</span>, just a few minutes away along the beach.</li><li>Visit nearby Nathon Walking Street <span style="font-weight: bold;">Night Market</span> on Thursdays or the bigger Fisherman’s Village Night Market in Bophut on Fridays.</li><li>Go <span style="font-weight: bold;">island hopping</span>! The Ang Thong National Marine Park encompasses a cluster of islands – the ones you can see from Tawantok Beach Villas. The heavily jungled islands are carefully controlled to keep them in pristine natural condition. A trip to them is a must.</li><li>There’s a <span style="font-weight: bold;">kite surfing</span> school on the beach at Nathon where you can rent a rig or learn how to do it.</li><li>Regular <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thai boxing</span> tournaments are staged at the largest stadium on the island, the Petch Buncha near Chaweng. These are not tourist demo fights; they are the real thing.</li><li>Samui has a number of spectacular <span style="font-weight: bold;">waterfalls</span>. We would recommend starting with the Namuang Falls. Take your bathing costume; there’s a very inviting pool at the base of the falls.</li><li>Have an <span style="font-weight: bold;">adventure </span>atop Khao Pom mountain on ATVs or the zipline, or just gaze out at the scenery below from the viewpoint.</li></ul>]]></Description>
