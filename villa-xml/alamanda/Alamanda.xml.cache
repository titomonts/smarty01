 A driver and car (seating up to seven passengers) is available to villa guests for eight hours a day at a cost of USD$25/day (excluding petrol). Alternatively, don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask the villa manager to call one of the island&rsquo;s safe and reasonably priced metered taxis.</p>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>
 Your villa manager has a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will be pleased to help with any tour or restaurant bookings. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Many of them live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.</p>
<p>
 In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Ubud&rsquo;s shops are filled with unique and beautiful crafts, art work, carvings, jewellery, and gifts to take back home. The sprawling, indoor <strong>Ubud Market </strong>caters mostly to tourists in search of cheap souvenirs. Be sure to haggle prices &ndash; negotiation is expected &ndash; or you may end up paying triple what something is worth.</li>
 <li>
  Ask your chef to escort you to the local produce market to buy fresh ingredients for an <strong>Indonesian cookery </strong>class back at the villa.</li>
 <li>
  Lush green rice fields still blanket much of the area around Ubud and can easily be reached on foot or bicycle. Do visit the <strong>UNESCO </strong>world heritage site at <strong>Tegallalang </strong>(13km) &ndash; the rice terraces will simply take your breath away.</li>
 <li>
  With scores of holistic medicine practitioners now living around Ubud, it is no surprise that so many spas and meditation centers have opened up. In town you will find all types of Eastern and Western therapies.</li>
 <li>
  A strange, natural phenomenon occurs each evening just north of Ubud in the village of <strong>Petulu </strong>(6.5km). Thousands of white herons arrive here around 6pm and prepare to roost for the night before flying off again in the morning. The birds first began coming here after a communist massacre in 1965 but no one is sure why they continue to return. Local lore holds that these are the souls of those that were killed. Such a predictable gathering of these large and beautiful birds is a spectacle not to be missed.</li>
 <li>
  No visit to Ubud is complete without seeing at least one traditional dance performance. Although the performances are very tourist-oriented, this is a great opportunity to see classic Hindu legends being told through dancers in colorful, traditional costumes. <strong>Ubud Palace </strong>is a popular place providing shows nightly. Or get the staff to arrange your own private dinner and dance at the villa.</li>
 <li>
  Just 1.5 kilometres from the villa lies one of the most sacred sites in Bali: Goa Gajah. Also known as the <strong>Elephant Cave</strong>, this Hindu site dates back to the 11th Century and is believed to have been home to Hindu priests. The site is still used for worship by locals so proper dress is required to enter.</li>
 <li>
  Two other very sacred places &ndash; Tirta Empul, the water temple at Tampak Siring and Gunung Kawi, an ancient archaeological temple complex of carved rock, are well worth a visit. Those wishing to bathe in the holy waters at Tirta Empul must dress appropriately (a sarong and sash can be hired on site).</li>
 <li>
  <strong>Kintamani </strong>in North Bali is home to Mount Batur and some of Bali&rsquo;s most dramatic scenery. Mount Batur is an active volcano that regularly smolders and surprises visitors with minor eruptions.</li>
 <li>
  While Ubud is not the obvious location for a beach holiday, we do recommend a day trip to <strong>White Sand Beach </strong>just north of Candidasa: a back-in-time place with beautiful sand, rolling waves, and an assortment of beach huts serving traditional beach food cooked over coconut coals. Why not stop off at the <strong>Bali Marine Safari Park </strong>on the way &ndash; a great treat for the kids.</li>
 <li>
  Finally while you will be hard pressed to beat the cooking of your own private chef, Ubud has some of the best restaurants on the island. Try Mozaic for fine dining, Bebek Bengil for crispy duck, Bridges for a romantic meal overlooking the Campuan River and the Melting Wok for Laotian fare.</li>
</ol>

      <Description><![CDATA[                                        <p> The family friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want. Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is a real plus – and one that means parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday too.<br /> <br /> While young children will need close supervision at Villa Alamanda because of its steep hillside location, it is a great villa for families with older kids. With a large swimming pool, lawn area for games and a media room well equipped with DVDs and indoor games, the kids will be kept well entertained.<br /> <br /> The team of friendly staff at Villa Alamanda make children feel as welcome as adults too, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost).<br /> <br /> Although the equipped kitchen allows meals for fussy eaters or babies to be prepared with ease, staff will happily to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest. The chef can customise all meals to suit children’s taste buds. Pancakes by the pool for breakfast? Milkshakes with your movie? No problem.<br /> <br /> Neither do you need to worry about packing all that cumbersome kids’ equipment for your stay. There are a number of children’s items already at the villa including a high chair and baby cot with mosquito net, but should you need anything else, equipment can be hired on your behalf (<a title="Children's equipment - Elite Havens" target="_blank" href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf">click here</a> to see list of available hire items).<br /> <br /> And when the excitement of exploring the villa starts to wear off, check out our <a target="_self" href="http://www.alamandabali.com/things-to-do.html" title="Villa Alamanda - things to do">Things to do</a> page; there’s plenty in the area to keep kids of all ages amused throughout the holiday.</p>                                     ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Villa Alamanda is a special place. After four years searching for the perfect location to create their dream holiday home, the owners decided on the lush jungle setting near Ubud, and their affection for this tropical paradise is evident as soon as you open the villa doors.<br /> <br /> Set high on a ravine amongst tall trees, lush green foliage and twittering birds this four-bedroom villa takes you back in time. Alamanda is part of a traditional wood-carvers’ village that conjures up images of the Bali of yesteryear. Here, guests are privy to the routines of daily Balinese life from elaborate Hindu ceremonies to children playing in the street.<br /> <br /> What really makes this villa special is the way its design complements its natural setting with alang-alang thatched roofs, wooden beams and polished floors featuring a large open-sided terrace to enjoy the balmy tropical climate. Air-conditioned king-size bedrooms with marble ensuite bathrooms provide the perfect respite from the heat along with the fully enclosed media room.<br /> <br /> The gardens are spectacular, with a 11 x 8 metre infinity pool that hangs over the ravine and a poolside balé just made for relaxing. Frangrant frangipanis, red heliconias and the bright-yellow alamanda (after which the villa is named) inject colour against the rich green foliage of the surrounding jungle.<br /> <br /> The villa’s location is convenient for accessing nearby attractions including Ubud, Goa Gajah (Elephant Cave) and the UNESCO rice terraces of Tegallalang. The villa staff team, including the villa’s experienced in-house chef, will look after you well: all meals can be selected from a suggestion menu on guest account. But if guests do wish to dine out, there are plenty of dining options in Ubud catering for every taste and budget.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Villa Alamanda is characterised by a delightful T-shaped terrace that stretches the length of the main house. This beautiful open-sided living space features polished wooden floors, high ceilings hung with overhead fans, and wooden balustrading that makes the most of the villa’s picturesque natural environment. Two daybeds adorned with silk cushions provide the perfect places to meditate and enjoy soothing sounds on the CD player.<br /> <br /> The dining area that juts out over the ravine and is furnished with a wooden table for eight, is the ideal spot for an intimate dinner party. The kitchen, which delivers exquisite meals, is housed in the staff quarters at the rear of the property.<br /> <br /> The fully enclosed air-conditioned media room adjacent to the garden suite is equipped with a large flat-screen satellite TV with DVD player, games, toys, movies, bean bags and a comfortable sofa.<br /> <br /> Its unique jungle setting is what makes Villa Alamanda special and the owners have designed the gardens to make the most of the tropical surroundings. An arched gateway with Balinese doors marks the entrance to the enchanting garden accessed by a flight of 17 stone stairs.<br /> <br /> A curved 11 x 8-metre blue-tiled infinity swimming pool gives the illusion of disappearing into the ravine as water cascades over its edge. Sun loungers and umbrellas rest on the Palimanan stone pool terrace strategically placed to capture the sun. A round outdoor dining table is ideal for casual poolside dining while the thatched balé, equipped with bright coloured cushions and a CD player, is perfect for sunset cocktails.<br /> <br /> A grassed area with two carved wooden seats and a traditional Hindu shrine makes a lovely setting for an intimate wedding blessing or a private yoga session.</p>]]></Description>

 Surrounded by lush tropical rainforest, Villa Alamanda is located five kilometres from Ubud near the sleepy wood-carvers village of Tengkulak. This traditional village offers a fascinating insight into daily Balinese life including the colourful and hypnotic Hindu ceremonies.<br />
 <br />
 While the villa enjoys a remote and quiet setting it is only a short drive to many of Bali&rsquo;s tourist hot spots including the famous Goa Gajah (Elephant Cave), the UNESCO rice fields of Tegallalang, the Tirta Girtu water temple at Tampak Siring, and the Bali Marine and Safari Park.<br />
 <br />
 The main attraction, though, has to be Ubud, Bali&rsquo;s cultural heart, famed for its art, wood carving, jewellery, textiles, antiques, restaurants, markets and cultural performances &ndash; including the Kacek dance. Three hundred metres above sea level in the foothills of the central mountain range, Ubud offers a cooler, wetter climate making it perfect for rice farming.</p>
