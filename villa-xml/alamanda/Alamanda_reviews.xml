	We were blown away by the serenity, the close-to-nature experience, the sound of the river and the enchanting, private garden. Dining alfresco on the wooden elevated deck was a lovely experience.</p>

	Located in Tengkulak Village, Villa Alamanda is five kilometres from the centre of Ubud, where there is a huge choice of restaurants, shops, museums and outdoor activities. The mysterious Goa Gajah &lsquo;Elephant Cave&rsquo; (1.5km) dates from the 11th century and is carved out of solid rock with a huge monstrous face at its entrance, which is supposed to frighten away evil. In front of the cave is an old bathing place where water pours out of jars held by four voluptuous female stone figures.<br />
	<br />
	Small eateries can be found all over Ubud and in the surrounding areas, but for a gourmet experience you might want to check out Mozaic or Lamak. Other recommended restaurants include Casa Luna, Kafe Batan Waru (classic Indonesian dishes taken from old family recipes), Caf&eacute; Lotus, or Indus (best at lunchtime) where you can enjoy delicious home cooking and a glorious valley and mountain view. Naughty Nuri&rsquo;s is a rustic Ubud institution, with a daily barbecue and dangerously strong martinis. Nightlife is limited but Ozigo is a happening scene. The town is great for shopping, and if you want to purchase artwork of any description then you&rsquo;re in the right place. There&rsquo;s a lively daily market (5km), and at the neighbouring villages you can watch master craftsmen and artisans at work. Outdoor activities include mountain cycling tours &ndash; exhilarating descents that conclude with a buffet lunch &ndash; and white-water rafting along the Ayung River. Bali Bird Park (9km) and the Elephant Safari Park (19km) provide great family days out. Other activities might include a few Bintang beers at sunset at a simple viewing station in Petulu Village (6km), where thousands of white herons come to roost at sunset. Additionally, you can go on a guided herb walk through the rice fields, a yoga session at the Yoga Barn (4km), a tour of the art galleries, participate at one of Ubud&rsquo;s Balinese cooking classes, watch a dance performance at the Royal Palace, or meet the mischievous macaques in the Sacred Monkey Forest (4km). If you are there in October, you can attend the annual Ubud Writers &amp; Readers Festival.</p>

    <ROverallComments><p>
	This out-of-town villa is a little gem that offers the best of both worlds. On the one hand you will find all the serenity and peace that you would expect from a countryside location, together with the enchantment of a Balinese village, yet you are only five kilometres from the centre of Ubud, where there is plenty to do, including shopping, sightseeing, trekking, river rafting and eating out. The villa itself is romantic, charming and furnished with love, but don&rsquo;t expect anything too high-tech or lots of fancy facilities because that&rsquo;s not what Villa Alamanda is about. It&rsquo;s more about rustic charm than funky architecture, and yes there might be one or two things that could be better maintained, but this is reflected in a very reasonable price. We found the staff to be efficient and friendly, and the chef&rsquo;s cooking is excellent.</p>
</ROverallComments>
    <RUnpleasantSurprise><p>
	The Garden Suite is a TV room that doubles as a fourth bedroom, but as there are no TVs/DVD players anywhere else in the villa, the occupants of this suite may not have as much privacy as they would like.</p>

    <ROverallComments>We have arrived home recommending Villa Alamanda to friends, family and work mates as a great place to escape to. Nothing was too hard, we were organised without being intruded on. Everyone loved the pool for swimming and hanging out.  As friends with teenagers there was privacy and communal space and we thought it was great to have a tv space that was comfortable but not prominant.  </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Our stay at Villa Alamanda was a memorable one. I am proud of myself for discovering this oasis, on the outskirts of Ubud.  Located in the heart of pure Bali, we were able to discover the rich culture of the island first hand whilst being accommodated in a surrounding of beauty and comfort at Villa Alamanda. Attention to detail everywhere.
Many, many thanks. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Villa Alamanda was wonderful. The setting is beautiful with a jungle backdrop. The pool area is particularly attractive and totally private. Bedrooms are tastefully presented in Balinese style and the dining area is under cover on the verandah overlooking the jungle. The staff are friendly and available when required, never intruding on your privacy. The food cooked by the chef is prepared with fresh ingredients sourced from the market daily and represented the best Indonesian food we experienced in Bali.
We were a family of 7 meeting for a reunion and could not have asked for more.
I would have no hesitation recommending this property for those seeking an alternative to boring generic hotels.</ROverallComments>

We really enjoyed walking around the village, visiting the local school and temples.  Can't recommend highly enough - all meals top quality, all staff were amazing (thank you Made & Ibu Made). We will be back.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Our stay at the villa was absolute luxury. The staff were brilliant, couldn't do enough for us, but also friendly and relaxed. They were fabulous with my 15 month old daughter Ella - the chef, Ibu Made, even watched her for a couple of hours one morning while my husband and I had massages. 
The food is divine. Many reviews mentioned the food and said we would not want to go out - given we had been to Bali before, and eaten out for every meal, I didn't really believe this. We ended up having dinner in more often than we went out - and the best meals we had in Bali were at the villa (and at the Bridges restaurant, where the food is excellent but pricey for Bali). 
The location outside of Ubud is not an issue, and the great facilities and large grounds and pool area are a real bonus. If you are in a group, I would highly recommend this villa.

Nothing was too much trouble and we had everything we could wish for..
The location was great, not far from Ubud but not too close. Ultimately we were just happy to sit by the pool and be spoilt with daily spa treatments.. Just fabulous...</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Ibu Made and staff make this villa just the best place to stay that anyone could imagine. The location is excellent, just a few minutes drive into Ubud and sitting peacefully on the side of a hill. Very quiet, clean and relaxing place to stay. The pool is amazing and our children had a lot of fun swimming and playing in the water. Don't bother eating out as Ibu Made and her team are amazing cooks and will provide anything that you ask for. We are a group of 4 adults and 4 children and everyone's food needs were looked after. I highly recommend this villa for families.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>This is our second visit to Alamanda and once again we had a fantastic time. Everything about this little gem is delightful. The personal yoga classes, spa treatments and massages, the wonderful cooking, the beautifully kept grounds and above all the STAFF. Without the staff it would be just another lovely villa. We were made to feel very special and cared for. We also love the fact the villa is outside of Ubud in a working village so we can soak up the sounds and atmosphere. Cant wait for an opportunity to return..</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We loved staying at Villa Alamanda, everything was great. Very minor comments include one bedroom's aircon could have been a bit cooler, but it is being replaced early October and in our group we had an elderly person, so the bathrooms provided a bit of a challenge since the (lovely) showers were over deep baths with steps. We stayed as an extended family in Ubud for a wedding at another venue and Villa Alamanda was like a luxury home away from home, with all the attention and more of a resort, but we had it just to ourselves. The staff are amazing and the cook Ibu Made is incredible - the manager was really considerate and I would highly recommend this amazing place to anyone wishing for peace, quiet, attention, a wonderful pool and gardens and just an fabulous experience. Thanks very much to all.  </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Villa Alamanda is a very nice property, with spacious bedrooms and the pool area is lovely. The staff is excellent and we had a very enjoyable stay there. Note that there is no attached common sitting area, and that the pool area is removed from the house itself, down a level and around the corner. It is very lovely though. The staff is wonderful and Ibu Made prepares the best food.  </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Villa Alamanda.The villa and the garden are beautiful. We loved the pool - the perfect place to relax after sightseeing and other activities. Apparently there is a TV room but we never needed it. While its not located in a typical Ubud padi field setting we did enjoy being in a village setting and out of the main tourist area. The staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive, but not overly so. They made this the most relaxing family holiday we have ever had. The food was delicious. </ROverallComments>

However with Villa Alamanda I'm convinced that it will be both. The zen-like tranquility of the house combine with the utter graciousness of the staff combine into An Experience that will not be quickly forgotten.

    <ROverallComments>Our first trip to Bali has been truly wonderful because of our stay in the beautiful Villa Alamanda. The staff team are just perfect. They are have provided some excellent and very tasty food. The staff team have answered our every need. We have been able to enjoy the beautiful garden and a wonderful pool experience. Our stay was also complemented by Gede the recommended villa driver who shared his local knowledge of the Balinese people and their culture.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Peaceful, beautiful, elegant.. a place where flora and fauna flourish happily. Quiet, comfortable,  tranquil.. a place where people can RELAX. All this let us experience a lazy and comfortable stay. The design is simple, impeccable and so so beautiful. I'd also like to thank the staff for their patient, kind and understanding hosting and care. It was simple and subtle. Thank you for the wonderful meals - especially dinner. Various plates and bowls full of different and unique dishes for the trying. It is so satisfying and unforgettable.

The peace and tranquility of this place is outstanding. Staff are attentive and always happy to help. Nyoman's food is the best we have tried in Bali. Gusti our driver is a very informative, extremely friendly and very patient. Thank you so much to the staff and of course Ely for making our stay an unforgettable experience.

The view and pool is beautiful and we could spend all day reading and watching the birds and trees. Don't be shy to ask beautiful Ely for tips, particularly where to eat.

    <ROverallComments>Many thanks to Ely and the wonderful team in this little slice of heaven! No request was too big and was always accompanied by a smile. Dining in the villa was a real treat. The Balinese family style. Food was delightful for our two families. Finding it hard to pack our bags for the next journey. Terima kasih.

We were a group of 5 friends and felt incredibly well-looked after and the care, attention and good spirit of all the staff made this an extraordinary experience. The meals have been beyond our expectations - so well presented and made with love. Thank you once again. We hope to see you again sometimes in the future.

    <ROverallComments>We thought the pictures on the website were amazing, but it does not do the spectacular Alamanda justice. What a breathtakingly BEAUTIFUL place! The team were so warm, welcoming, and nothing was too difficult . It has been the perfect holiday. The house was comfortable and had everything we needed. The grounds and gardens were picturesque. The food was delicious. The village and surrounds were enchanting. But the absolute highlight was the sparkling pool. We could spend all day there! We would never stay anywhere else in Bali.

    <ROverallComments>Thank you so much for your warmth and welcoming hospitality. You guys made our trip extra special. My father was sick throughout the whole trip and you guys took special care of him and treated him like your own father. You all entertained our kids and treated them like they were your own kids. You made sure they had their hot chocolates, nutella, ice cream and chicken whenever they requested for it. Nyoman prepared and cooked nice food - pizzas, local delicacies, desserts, pancakes etc you name it! It has been a perfect holiday all in all because of you guys - you never said 'No' to any of our requests and that's the best part. We hope to come here again and meet all of you soon. We love you.

    <ROverallComments>lovely place to stay. The cook Ida was really great. Great place to relax but pity about the goat track to get to the villa.
The middle floor bathroom is very tired and the floor drainage needs to be looked but overall we had a lovely time.

    <ROverallComments>We stayed at Villa Alamando for three  nights before we went to Seminyak for a week there in another house. We regret that we didn't spend moredays in Ubud and Alamanda. The house was great , the location likewise and the staff was excellent more than excellent actually, we had tears in our eyes when we had to leave.
We have nothing but good things to say about Alamanda and can recommend it to anyone who likes to visit Bali.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>This villa was a fantastic holiday experience.  We had room to spread out or be together as a family.  Everything was spotless and the staff were exceptionally well trained and hospitable.   I highly recommend this for a family mix of 8 people.  We had 2 grannies, 2 babies, a teenager and 3 young parents and it was great. Edi was our driver for 10  hours per day and he was brilliant.  The laundry was done daily (even ironed!!!) if we dropped clothes in the basket.  It is a great rest for a mum.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We thorougly enjoyed our stay at Villa Alamanda and were disappointed it went so quickly! We loved the look and feel of the villa and the grounds. The grounds and the pool were so beautiful, we rarely left them. One of the biggest positives was the staff. Having the same set of staff consistently meant we felt we got to know them. Their level of attention to detail and their friendly attitude made us feel pampered and welcome. And of course Ibu Made's cooking!!! I'm afraid we worked her very hard, eating in every night because her cooking was so good! We would love to go back to Villa Alamanda when we can. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>villa Alamanda is à lovely villa in à beautifull surrounding. everything you need is available in the house. The very friendly and profesional staf is always there to help you. Ibu Made is a very, very good cook. She always comes with ideas for à daytrip and suggestion for an outstanding meal.  As on Bali, the temperature is always nice, so therefor you do not miss the absence of an indoor livingroom as we are used to in Europe. The driver takes you everywhere you want. it is no option to take a little stroll from the villa into the neighbourhood.
We would recommend this villa to everyone!

    <ROverallComments>Really pleasant stay. Bedrooms were a great size, the air conditioning leaked in the master bedroom on the 2nd day but that was a minor thing. Bathrooms were lovely but baths were so big it would take forever to fill up given the water pressure. Would be good if there was a living space to watch TV/DVD that wasn't one of the bedrooms. The pool and surrounding area was the highlight. Stunning.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>This villa was a joy to stay in. Ibu Made and the team at the villa made our stay very special. Ask for Eddy the driver who took us everywhere we wanted. The whole staff went beyond the call of duty. We had a party at the villa during our stay and it was catered and decorated so beautifully. We would love to come back.</ROverallComments>
