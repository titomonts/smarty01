      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Ideally situated between Berawa Beach with its laid-back surfer vibe and Batu Belig with its host of glamorous beach clubs, Canggu Beachside Villas boast one of Bali’s most sought-after locations. A mere one-minute walk from the beach and a gorgeous natural lagoon, the villas are a great choice for families or groups wanting to experience this beautiful part of Bali in luxury and style. When all three of these exceptional private villas are booked together they can sleep up to 24 guests. </p><p>Connected via a private walkway, each Canggu Beachside Villa has a separate entrance, private garden and a swimming pool. These villas have been designed to dazzle their guests with a wonderful combination of minimalist simplicity and open, light-filled spaces. Following the principles of ‘organic architecture’, the villas’ indoor spaces are in perfect harmony with their natural surroundings. Their lush tropical gardens and ‘Zen’ water features, along with elegant furnishings and authentic Indonesian art create a very special atmosphere both indoors and out. This really is exotic chic at its very best.</p><p>There’s a small army of staff on hand, including a villa manager, butlers and a housekeeper who will happily tend to your every need, as well as a team of diligent security staff. </p><p>Being so close to many of Canggu and Seminyak’s best eateries means most of our guests prefer to dine out, which is why the Canggu Beachside Villas do not employ a private chef. Should you prefer to have a chef on-site, we would be happy to arrange this for an additional charge.&nbsp; </p><p>Just click on these links to find out more about the five-bedroom Villa Gu, the four-bedroom Villa Vida and the three-bedroom Villa Boa. Or visit the Canggu Beachside Villas website to see how they can be combined to meet your specific holiday requirements.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The Canggu Beachside Villas are located in the village of Berawa on the border between Canggu and Seminyak. Berawa is rapidly becoming a hotspot for surfers who enjoy riding its long beach break, as well with foodies who revel in its dazzling number of coffee shops, delis and restaurants, and shoppers who will enjoy browsing the many boutiques in nearby Canggu.</p><p>The villas are only a one-minute walk from the beach and from a beautiful natural lagoon, where colourful outriggers are pulled up on the sands, ready to head out to sea on their nightly fishing trips.</p><p>To get to the beach you’ll walk past La Laguna, a stunning beach bar and restaurant entirely made out of driftwood, and probably one of the most photogenic spots on the island. From there, take a picturesque stroll along the sand towards other popular surfing spots such as Batu Bolong Beach (3km) and Echo Beach (4km) to the north. The swell is quite strong on this side of the island, so we don’t recommend swimming. </p><p>Walk five hundred metres along the beach to the south and you’ll be able to indulge in the glitz and glamour of some of Seminyak’s most popular beach clubs like Tropicola, W Hotel, Ku Dé Ta and Potato Head. </p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Your villa manager will have plenty of information about all the places of interest in the area and can arrange transport or make bookings for you. In fact, many of the staff live locally and will be happy to give you some interesting insights into many aspects of Bali life.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of some of the varied activities on offer within easy reach of the villas.</p><ul><li>Enjoy sundowners or an evening meal at <span style="font-weight: bold;">La Laguna</span>, a restaurant and bar entirely made out of driftwood. This is probably the most romantic spot you’ll find on the island, with magical sunset views over the lagoon and the beach. </li><li>Finns Recreation Club ¬– just down the road from the villas – provides hours of <span style="font-weight: bold;">entertainment for the whole family.</span> It has first class facilities including a restaurant, bar and lounge, a library, a kids’ club and a really cool water park. Or visit Finns Beach Club, just 500 metres to the north of La Laguna, and enjoy poolside cocktails in the spectacular bamboo clubhouse overlooking the pool and ocean.</li><li>If you enjoy <span style="font-weight: bold;">eating out</span>, you’ll find some exciting and high-quality choices in the village of Berawa. For breakfast and lunch, head over to Coffee ‘n Oven, which has an excellent choice of European-type pastries. Or try some organic home-grown vegetables underneath the huge tippy-tent at Parachute – only a ten-minute walk from the villas. For dining we can recommend Milu which serves excellent Indonesian and western dishes in a beautiful atmospheric garden, or The Piring Daun for tasty Indian fusion cuisine.</li><li>Children will love hanging out at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Equestrian Centre</span>, a world-class destination for riders and tourists. Its facilities have been designed to accommodate the entire family with pony rides and day camps for the little ones, lessons, family village tours and beach rides. </li><li>Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and nearby rural villages such as Pererenan and Seseh by bicycle; a great way to<span style="font-weight: bold;"> get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali.</span> Stop off at a local<span style="font-style: italic;"> warung</span> (eatery) to sample some basic Balinese fare.</li><li>The Canggu Beachside Villas are only a 45-minute drive from the famous <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tanah Lot sea temple</span>, one of Bali’s most important temples, and also one of its most popular tourist attractions. You can expect a lot of people and camera phones if you visit during sunset, especially during peak holiday season. We advise visiting early in the morning (8-9am) when there are less people and you’ll have a much better chance to really experience the power of this sacred place.</li><li>Play a round at the well-laid out 18-hole <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Beach Golf Course</span> in Sanur or the 85-hectare<span style="font-weight: bold;"> New</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kuta Golf Course</span> on the Bukit Peninsula, for fantastic ocean views. </li><li>&nbsp;Drive westwards to explore the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan regency</span>, revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned temple – Pura Ulun Danu.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>This beautiful enclave of three luxury private villas in Berawa – one of Bali’s most up and coming areas, ideally located between Canggu and Seminyak – is a mere stone’s throw away from a wide sandy beach and a gorgeous natural lagoon. </p><p>Following the principles of ‘organic architecture’ – a term first coined by Frank Lloyd Wright in the early 20th Century – the villas have been designed to highlight their harmonious relationship with the natural environment, creating a tranquil oasis and a real sense of being at one with nature both indoors and out. While sharing the same modern minimalist style, every villa has its own unique character thanks to an esoteric choice of art and decoration by individual owners. </p><p>The three Canggu Beachside Villas each have their own garden and private pool, as well as plenty of outdoor seating. There’s enough space to keep the children entertained, and the villas’ convenient layout makes it easy to keep a watchful eye out from pretty much anywhere on the property. </p><p>The villas are connected by discreet garden gates leading onto a private walkway. Each villa can be rented separately, or in a variety of combinations to suit your specific holiday requirements. </p><p>All three villas have a private rooftop terrace overlooking the ocean and the surrounding rice fields, providing front-row seats to some of the most amazing sunsets you’ll ever see – perhaps accompanied by a cocktail freshly made by one of your butlers. </p><p>Speaking of which, the professionalism and friendliness of the Canggu Beachside Villas’ staff will make your stay unforgettable. Because of the villas’ proximity to some of Canggu and Seminyak’s top eating spots a private chef is not included in the villa rate, but can be easily arranged on request. </p><p>If you’re looking for a sumptuous beachside haven to entertain your group, the Canggu Beachside Villas are a perfect choice.</p>]]></Description>

Not having to worry about disturbing other guests is also a plus – creating a more relaxing time for parents and children too. </p><p>The layout of each Canggu Beachside Villa makes it relatively easy to keep an eye out on the pool and the surrounding gardens, and a pool fence can be hired on request to provide extra safety if you have very small children (extra charge applies). Removing any mealtime stress, kids favourites can be prepared with ease in the villas’ well-equipped kitchens </p><p>And don’t let bulky children’s equipment take up all your precious luggage allowance.

While the ocean swell is too heavy for swimming – even for adults ¬– the calmer water in the nearby lagoon means children can splash around safely.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;Should you want to explore beyond the villas, be sure to check out our Things to Do page.
