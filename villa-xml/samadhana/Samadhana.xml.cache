      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Gede, Villa Samadhana’s manager, has a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Do also ask other staff about the local area. Invariably some of them will live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.<br /> <br /> In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.</p><ol><li>If you’ve always dreamt of galloping along the beach at sunset, now’s your chance. Saba Bay stables, can arrange <strong>horse riding trails</strong> along the black sands and crashing waves at nearby Saba Beach, passing bamboo and alang-alang plantations and local temples.</li><li>You’re just a 20-minute drive from the <strong>historical village of Sanur,</strong>  Bali’s original tourist enclave. Its lovely broad expanse of golden  sands sheltered by a reef makes this for the perfect spot for safe  swimming. Make the most of the diverse array of water sports available  and some excellent eating places along the five-kilometre seafront  promenade.</li><li>Don’t miss a trip up to Bali’s <strong>cultural and artistic hub, Ubud,</strong>  a 25-minute scenic drive. This is the best place to catch traditional  Balinese dance performances – especially at the town’s Royal Palace,  magically illuminated at night. Ubud has also recently evolved as an  upmarket destination, boasting cutting-edge restaurants like Mozaic and  world-class spas such as award-winning Como Shambhala.</li><li>You can purchase plenty of arts, crafts and souvenirs in Ubud, but why not get them at source, at Ubud’s outlying <strong>traditional artisan villages</strong>?  There’s wider options at great value to be found at Celuk, famous for  silverware, Batubulan for stone carvings, Mas for wood carvings and  Sukawati, for its arts and crafts market – all just 10- to 20-minutes’  drive away.</li><li>Just off the mainland are the islands of Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida – both famous for their <strong>scuba diving and </strong><strong>snorkelling</strong>,  with excellent dive sites and rich marine life. Boat trips from Sanur  or Padangbai can easily be arranged. Further along the east coast, Amed  and Tulamben offer isolated reefs – the latter, also has shipwreck  diving.</li><li><strong>Bali Safari &amp; Marine Park</strong> (7km) offers a fun  family day out. Home to hundreds of amazing animals representing more  than 50 species, it presents a tram ride through the animal enclosures, a  marine aquarium, a theatre, animal educational and entertainment shows,  as well as the Fun Zone where visitors can get wet and wild in the  Waterpark or embark on a Jungle Cruise.</li><li>Fashionistas and shop-a-holics should drive over to the west coast – around 45 minutes away – where you’ll find Bali’s most <strong>cosmopolitan enclave, Seminyak. </strong>Here,  indulge in globally-inspired gourmet restaurants, stylish boutiques and  hipper-than-thou bars – including the much hyped Ku Dé Ta, on Seminyak  beachfront.</li><li>The most exclusive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali trekking tour</span> promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href=" http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title="Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. ">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. </a><br /></li><li>The stretch of beach between Sanur and Ketewel is well known as a <strong>surfer’s heaven</strong>  (especially from November to May, when the winds turn offshore on this  side of the island), but beginners should beware of strong, swirling  currents. Good breaks can be found at Keramas, Ketewel and Cucukan.</li><li><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pulaugroup.co.id">Pulau Dive Charters</a></strong>  offers luxury boat charters around  the beautiful islands and waters  surrounding Bali. They specialise in private fishing, surfing  and  diving charters  and also offer unique personalised day trips to Nusa  Lembongan. Perfect for a  family day out on the water or with a group of  friends.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ol><ul></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> The family friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want. Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is a real plus – and one that means parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday too.<br /> <br /> Villa Samadhana is a great villa for families, however toddlers will need to be carefully supervised around the fish ponds and water features. Kids will love the wide open spaces just perfect for a game of football. The enormous 25-metre swimming pool features a special shallow section for the little ones and a range of pool toys. If it happens to be a rainy day don’t despair, the villa is well equipped with children’s DVDs and games and the entertainment pavilion provides plenty of space for kids to play.<br /> <br /> The team of friendly staff at Villa Samadhana will make children feel as welcome as adults, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost).<br /> <br /> Although the equipped kitchen allows you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will happily to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest. Banana pancakes by the pool for breakfast? Toasted sandwiches in the TV lounge for lunch? No problem. The chef can customise all meals to suit children’s taste buds.<br /> <br /> Don’t worry about packing all that cumbersome kids’ equipment for your stay. Just let us know what you need, and anything we don’t have in-house (villa facilities include a baby cot, highchair and car seat) we can hire on your behalf (click <a href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf" target="_blank" title="Children's equipment - Elite Havens">here</a> to see list of available hire items).<br /> <br /> And when the excitement of exploring the villa starts to wear off, check out our <a href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html" target="_self" title="Villa Samadhana - things to do">Things to do</a> page; there’s plenty in the area to keep all of the family amused throughout the holiday.</p>]]></Description>

 If you crave space, peace and privacy then indulge yourself at Villa Samadhana. Named after the ancient Sanskrit word for &lsquo;inner peace&rsquo;, this five-bedroom villa has been designed to encourage guests to relax, unwind and dissolve the stresses of everyday life in a beautiful tropical setting on Bali&rsquo;s south-east coast.<br />

A stunning 25-metre infinity pool with adjoining entertainment pavilion offers ocean views, as does the massive master bedroom.<br />
 <br />
 Large open-air living spaces with high vaulted ceilings enable guests to freely enjoy the balmy Balinese climate, inhale the fragrant smells of the garden and marvel at the tiny birds and water hens that twitter and flutter throughout the grounds. Thai silk furnishings and a collection of Asian antiques reflect the owner&rsquo;s exquisite taste and style that has gone into making each room special and unique.<br />
 <br />
 A standout feature of this home is the spacious restaurant-grade kitchen with its gleaming black granite worktops where the experienced chef will happily prepare meals to tantalise your taste-buds. With a team of dedicated staff, including a private butler, the villa consistently delivers five-star service, whether providing cocktails by the pool or arranging deluxe in-house spa treatments.<br />

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>
 Villa Samadhana is located in the sleepy seaside village of Ketewel, 13 kilometres from Sanur along Bali&rsquo;s south-east coast. Hidden behind coral-limestone walls a few hundred metres from the glistening black shores of Pabean Beach, the villa offers ocean views from the pool area and master bedroom, as well as glimpses of Mount Agung in the distance.<br />
 <br />
 Surrounded by rice fields, tobacco plantations, papaya, banana and coconut groves this is still a very traditional area untouched by tourism, however access to the bypass means it is only a ten-minute drive to Sukawati&rsquo;s art and craft market, fifteen minutes to the caf&eacute;s and restaurants of Sanur and 30 minutes to the cultural capital of Ubud.<br />
 <br />
 Ketewel itself is the birthplace of the celebrated Legong Bededari Dance, and the neighbouring village of Saba produced the finest Legong dancers on the island. Pabean was once a small port through which oriental traders brought their products; at low tide you can still see the structure of the old harbour, and a Chinese cemetery is located nearby. Balinese Hindu purification ceremonies are held beside the ocean at the sacred Pura Segara sea temple, and the glistening black sandy stretch of coastline is popular with surfers and beachcombers, but swirling currents and a lack of lifeguards make it unsuitable for swimming.</p>]]></Description>
