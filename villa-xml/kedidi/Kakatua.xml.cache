      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The villa manager will have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Invariably many of them will live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.</p><p>In the meantime, here’s a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of Villa Kakatua.</p><ul><li>A string of naturally beautiful beaches, some renowned for their surf, are right on the villa’s doorstep. Head down to Batu Bolong Beach or take a leisurely stroll along the sands to the legendary surfing haunt, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Echo Beach</span>. Whichever beach you choose, all are in prime position for fabulous sunsets.</li><li>Immediately next door is the fascinating, 5-star <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hotel Tugu</span> Bali. Bali’s first museum-hotel is studded with priceless Indonesian artworks and antiques, while its award-winning spa offers age-old Eastern therapies. You can even order room service to the villa!</li><li>Trek through local villages, rice fields and onto the beach with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kuda P riding stables</span>, based in Pererenan. These guided rides are suitable for everyone from total beginner to the experienced rider and range from half an hour (perfect for the kids) to two hours. Transfers to and from local villas are included in the price.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Old Mans</span>, just a five-minute walk down the road towards the beach, is a great spot for a bite to eat and a drink or two. Or cross the road to sip on Sangria at <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Lawn</span>, and watch Bali surfers ride the waves. Party at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pretty Poison</span> on Thursday and Saturday nights or, if you’re looking for a quieter night, head down there on Mondays when the whole place is transformed into an outdoor candle-lit movie theatre.</li><li>Make the<span style="font-style: italic;"> de rigueur</span> pilgrimage to sacred <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pura Tanah Lot</span>, one of Bali’s biggest tourist magnets. Perched high on a craggy wave-lashed rock, this ancient sea temple is best savoured at sunset, however there are less crowds early morning; make sure you receive a blessing from the Hindu Priests.</li><li>Fashionistas, trendies and shop-a-holics should hotfoot it down to Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Seminyak</span>. Here, you can indulge for hours in the glut of global-inspired gourmet restaurants, stylish boutiques and hipper-than-thou bars.</li><li>The most exclusive<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Bali trekking tour </span>promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href="http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title="Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise.">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise.</a></li><li>There are several <span style="font-weight: bold;">surf schools</span> in Bali, mainly based in and around Kuta and Legian, where young and old(er) can learn to surf or brush up on their skills. Ask your villa manager for local recommendations.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Treetop Adventure Park</span> is near the town of Bedugal in northern central Bali (next to Lake Bratan). Five adventure circuits, with heights ranging from two to 20 metres, challenge all level and ages on suspended bridges, spider nets, tarzan jumps and 12 flying foxes.</li><li>Explore beneath the waves with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Aquamarine Diving – Bali</span>, a British owned and managed dive shop running PADI dive courses, dive safaris and day dive trips to a number of exciting sites around Bali. The owner’s concept for Aquamarine has always been to plan dive experiences in the way that she would want arrangements made were she a visitor to Bali.&nbsp; As a result, this PADI 5 Star dive resort offers great personal service and highly experienced dive instructors.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom</span> Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ul>]]></Description>

 A private path bordered by plants and limestone carvings leads to Villa Kakatua&rsquo;s traditional Balinese doors. Behind these doors guests are greeted by an <em>aling-aling </em>wall (a short partition wall which, according to traditional belief, protects the villa from bad spirits), a fishpond and a bubbling water feature.<br />
 <br />
 The main two-storey pavilion houses the master suite, one guest bedroom, the living area and the kitchen. Adjacent to this is the dining <em>bal&eacute;</em>, and to the far side of that the other two guest bedrooms lie side by side below a thatched roof.<br />
 <br />
 Each room faces the lagoon-style pool and lush gardens enabling guests to enjoy the peace and tranquillity from every angle, while those wishing to embrace the spiritual side of Bali can observe daily offerings being made to the gods at the villa&rsquo;s very own garden temple.</p>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> All four of Villa Kakatua’s air-conditioned bedrooms are similar in  design with polished cream terrazzo floors, ceiling fans, beautifully  carved wooden beds draped with mosquito nets and antique batik throws.  Tastefully decorated with Javanese antiques and traditional paintings  and portraits, the rooms are very homely and comfortable. iPod docks in  all bedrooms and TV/DVD players (in all but bedroom four) add a modern  touch, while the lovely garden bathrooms, dotted with bluestone pebbles  and with open-air showers, inject tropical style.<br /> <br /> The ground  floor master suite (with the additional luxury of a tub in its bathroom)  lies immediately off the main living area, with glass sliding doors  opening onto the pool. The upstairs guest bedroom has great views over  the gardens and is accessed by a wooden staircase from the living room.<br /> <br />  Bedrooms three and four are tucked away in their own pavilion with a  shared veranda for cheeky daytime naps on the comfortable bright red  daybeds.&nbsp; One of these rooms features a giant four-poster bed large  enough to sleep four children (2 of which may incur extra cost) or two  adults. <br /></p>]]></Description>
