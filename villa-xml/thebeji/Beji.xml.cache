      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Dreaming of an insta-perfect villa vacation? A private sanctuary in peaceful surroundings yet close to cocktails-at-sunset surfing beaches and hipster-cool restaurants? It doesn’t get any better than The Beji, a sprawling six-bedroom garden estate in the heart of Canggu on Bali’s south-western coast. </p><p>With multiple pavilions and a massive amount of space, this spectacular no-expense-spared villa ticks all the boxes for two or three families (or a group of discerning friends) who love holidaying together, yet welcome some breathing space away from the crowd. Guests enjoy their own private retreats as every bedroom is set in an individual pavilion complete with large terrace and semi-garden bathroom with tub for two. A pair of enormous master suites mirror each other across the length of the pool while the four guest pavilions are arranged in pairs on either side of the lawn. </p><p>Plentiful living areas include an air-conditioned media room with 60-inch TV and digital movie library, and a Japanese tatami style massage area encircled by a koi pond. Throughout, contemporary furniture and luxury fittings sit comfortably under vaulted ironwood roofs. </p><p>The villa’s magnificent 21-metre pool is the visual and social focus, with single and double loungers on the sun deck and lawn, surrounded by frangipanis and palms. In an area of the estate edged by rice fields, the sports hub boasts a floodlit tennis court, air-conditioned gym, mini football pitch, basketball hoop and a trampoline.</p><p>And if that isn’t enough to entertain everyone, guests can enjoy the world-class facilities of Finns Recreation Club a five-minute walk away, as well as VIP access to uber-cool Finns Beach Club; the villa’s Finns Platinum membership gives up to six guests a day free access, worth almost U$300 a day. </p><p>But with such a fabulous setting, extensive range of facilities, and smiling full-time staff to pamper your every whim — including a villa manager and a competent chef, who’s to say you’ll want to leave? </p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The Beji is located in the heart of Canggu a few kilometres north of Seminyak and only 500 metres from Finns Recreation Club. Though hidden down a quiet lane edged by rice fields, the area’s many hipster cafes — among them newcomers Parachute and Savage Kitchen — are a stroll away. A five-minute drive, and you’re at Finns Beach Club and the expanse of black volcanic sand at Berawa Beach — perfect for surfing, sunset walks and people-watching. And in 15 minutes you can be in the heart of Seminyak, with its myriad acclaimed restaurants, boutiques and spas.</p>]]></Description>

Take care when swimming, however, as the waves can be a little rough at times. Remember to swim between the flags and look out for small children.</li><li>Take a <span style="font-weight: bold;">ride into Seminyak</span> to enjoy a <span style="font-weight: bold;">shopping </span>spree at the boutiques along the streets of this most fashionable neighbourhood. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pamper yourself in a spa</span>, dine well at one of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">many great restaurants</span> found here, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">soak up the sun at a hip beach club.</span></li><li>Desa Seni at Berawa Beach, is an eco-friendly village resort providing an authentic Indonesian experience through the exploration of culture, art and yoga. The resort offers a wide variety of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yoga classes</span> and also has its own spa.</li><li>Visit the mystical <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hotel Tugu</span> (Bali’s first museum-hotel) studded with priceless Indonesian artworks and antiques.

Although in peak season you can expect a lot of people and camera phones at sunset, an early morning visit (8-9am) provides a better idea of the power of the location and the chance to see it undisturbed apart from perhaps an offering ceremony.</li><li>Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and rural villages by bicycle; a great way to <span style="font-weight: bold;">get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali</span>. Stop off at a local warung (eatery) to sample some basic Balinese fare or cool off with a cold drink.</li><li>A great day out for kids of all ages, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Treetop Adventure Park</span> is near the town of Bedugal in northern central Bali (next to Lake Bratan). Five adventure circuits, with heights ranging from two to 20 metres, challenge all level and ages on suspended bridges, spider nets, Tarzan jumps and 12 flying foxes.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The word ‘Beji’ signifies water, specifically purification with holy water. It is the perfect name for this spectacular villa, which is reached via a moss-covered bridge over a small stream (heard but out of sight behind a bank of towering trees bordering the estate). The sound of water pervades the gardens, with its myriad koi ponds and water features. And occasionally the percussive sound of the gamelan drifts across from the Pura Beji temple in the night air.</p><p>The generosity of space is evident the moment you step through the monumental three-metre-high entrance door and into the living pavilion. From there, beyond a water-wall cascading down to the lower terrace, the manicured lawn unfurls towards the fabulous 21-metre pool. The six bedroom suites each occupy individual ironwood pavilions in a contemporary take on traditional Balinese architecture that accords the luxury of space and privacy for two or three families holidaying together. This is indoor-outdoor living at its best, with many quiet, casual chill-out zones and yet lots of space for socialising too. </p><p>Days are as lazy or action-filled as you like when you can sunbathe on the deck, smash a few balls on the tennis court, work out in the gym, lose yourself in a movie, book or PS4 game. Kids can wallow in the pool’s twin shallow sections, or work off energy bouncing on the trampoline and running around on the lawn while parents keep an eye from the comfort of their private terrace. </p><p>Do take full advantage of the accomplished villa chef and gather in the huge living pavilion for a convivial lunch, followed by sunset cocktails on the alfresco terrace lounge and a seafood barbecue among a sea of candles as dusk falls and fairy lights twinkle. Then retreat to the sanctuary of your glamorous suite for a romantic twosome bath and a restorative night’s sleep. </p><p>If you can bear to leave this paradise, the wide expanse of black-sand beach and Canggu’s hipster restaurant scene are moments away. Or make full use of the villa’s complimentary Finns Platinum membership, which gives up to six guests a day free access to the world-class facilities of Finns Recreation Club a five-minute walk away, as well as VIP access to uber-cool Finns Beach Club.</p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>The only upper-level room at the villa, and a sure-fire hit with the kids, the media room offers an air-conditioned sanctuary under a vaulted roof. A comfortable L-shaped sofa, two ottomans and a pair of squishy beanbags are set before a 60-inch TV with sound system, DVD player and Playstation 4. There’s a digital movie library, shelves of fiction and children’s books, and lots of toys. And those with a little homework to do while on holiday will find the desk handy.</p>]]></Description>

One of the pavilions has a Japanese tatami-style platform rising above a koi pond, where guests may enjoy a massage soothed by the sound of fountains. </p>]]></Description>

Resting on the manicured lawn opposite are more sun-loungers and a statement sculptural loveseat.

The floodlit tennis court with its umpire chair and bale invites hearty family tournaments — or use it as a basketball pitch. Alongside is a flat area with soccer nets, and a trampoline for kids to work off their excess energy. Within this space, an air-conditioned pavilion houses the gym, where guests may use the free weights and work out on the treadmill, cross-trainer, and air rower while enjoying pleasing views.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Family facilities at Villa The Beji are outstanding. The villa has been designed to allow children to explore independently and safely, without you having to worry, which means that you can have a relaxed holiday too, as well as the freedom to create your own schedule. Everyone can do or eat what they want, when they want, and where they want — work off excess energy running around on the lawn or bouncing on the trampoline, playing football, badminton or basketball, or learning to swim or play tennis (we can arrange for a private coach).</p><p>If that’s not enough to keep them busy, a short walk away are the facilities of Finns Recreation Club, including a Kids Club, 10-pin bowling and an amazing waterpark with slides galore. Check out our <a href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html" target="_blank" title="Things to do">Things to do</a> page as well: the beach is a ten-minute walk away, and there’s plenty in the area to keep all the family amused throughout the holiday.</p><p>The Balinese are famous worldwide for their kindness towards children and babies and staff at Villa The Beji will make children feel very much at home; children aren't just accepted here, they are treated as valued guests. The staff are happy to befriend your little ones to allow you the flexibility you need to relax and enjoy your holiday, and a full-time babysitter/nanny can be hired through the villa manager for a small additional cost.</p><p>The chef will be more than happy to customise meals to suit children’s taste buds, prepare special meals for fussy eaters, whiz up some baby puree, or serve kiddies’ snacks beside the pool – whenever you wish. Just discuss your requirements with the staff and they will take care of the rest. The Beji is so thoughtfully equipped for children, toddlers, and babies, you won’t need to worry about having to bring all that bulky kids’ equipment with you; let us know what you need, and anything we don’t have in-house (villa facilities include a baby cot, highchair and child car seat) we can hire on your behalf (<a href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf" target="_blank" title="click here">click here</a> to see list of available hire items).</p>]]></Description>
