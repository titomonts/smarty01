      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Indrani is located at the end of a quiet road very close to Berawa Beach – a wide sandy expanse close to Seminyak.&nbsp; This side of Berawa Beach feels relatively unspoilt with its fishing huts and outriggers parked up on the sand ready to go out at night to catch fresh fish.&nbsp; Nearby is a beautiful natural lagoon ¬– the largest in Canggu – which you can cross via a charming wooden bridge.&nbsp; Before crossing the bridge, you’ll walk past La Laguna – one of Canggu’s most photogenic and popular beach clubs. Made entirely out of driftwood, this place oozes romance and is a fantastic spot to catch the sunset. </p><p>Berawa Beach has a reputation for being an excellent surfing spot, especially for intermediate and accomplished surfers.&nbsp; From here, you can walk along the beach to other popular surfing spots such as Batu Bolong Beach and Echo Beach.&nbsp; Or you can walk fifteen minutes south along the beach to experience the glitz and glamour of Seminyak’s most popular beach clubs including W Hotel, Ku Dé Ta and Potato Head.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the village of Berawa has plenty of excellent coffee shops, restaurants and boutiques to choose from.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Indrani’s manager has plenty of information about all the places of interest in the area and can arrange transport or make bookings for you. In fact, many of the villa staff live locally and if you’re interested they will be happy to give you some interesting insights into aspects of Bali life.</p> <p>Here’s a quick overview of some of the many and varied activities on offer within easy reach of the villa.</p><ul><li>A visit to Finns Recreation Club ¬– just down the road from Villa Indrani – means hours of <span style="font-weight: bold;">entertainment for the whole family</span>. It has first class facilities including a restaurant, bar and lounge, a library, a kids’ club and a really cool water park. Or you can visit its beach club instead, which is located further down Berawa Beach. It has a spectacular bamboo building from where you can enjoy poolside cocktails and entertainment throughout the day.</li><li>If you enjoy <span style="font-weight: bold;">eating out</span>, you’ll find some exciting and high-quality choices in the village of Berawa. For breakfast and lunch, head over to Coffee ‘n Oven, which has an excellent choice of European-type pastries. Or try some organic homegrown vegetables underneath the huge tippy-tent at Parachute – only a two-minute walk from the villa. For dining we can recommend Milu, which serves excellent Indonesian and western dishes in a beautiful atmospheric garden, or The Piring Daun for tasty Indian fusion cuisine.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Children</span> will love hanging out at the Bali Equestrian Centre, a world-class destination for riders and tourists. Its facilities have been designed to accommodate the entire family with pony rides and day camps for the little ones, lessons, family village tours and beach rides.</li><li>Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and nearby rural villages such as Pererenan and Seseh by bicycle; a great way to <span style="font-weight: bold;">get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali</span>. Stop off at a local <span style="font-style: italic;">warung</span> (eatery) to sample some basic Balinese fare.</li><li>Villa Indrani is only a 45-minute drive from the famous sea temple of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tanah Lot</span>, one of Bali’s most important temples, and also one of its most popular tourist attractions. You can expect a lot of people and camera phones if you visit during sunset, especially during peak holiday season. We advise visiting early in the morning (8-9am) when there are less people and you’ll have a much better chance to really experience the power of this sacred place.</li><li>Play a round at the well-laid-out 18-hole <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Beach Golf Course</span> in Sanur or the 85-hectare <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Kuta Golf Course</span> on the Bukit Peninsula, for fantastic ocean views.</li><li>Drive westwards to explore the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan regency</span>, revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned temple – Pura Ulun Danu.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa holidays are a great option for families, providing plenty of private and secure space for everyone, and giving guests the freedom to choose what they want to do and when they want to do it. Not having to worry about disturbing other guests is also a plus – creating a more relaxing time for parents and children too. </p><p>The wide glass doors fronting Villa Indrani’s living and dining space make it easy to keep an eye out on the pool and garden, and a pool fence can be hired on request to provide additional safety for toddlers (extra charge applies). Although the lawn in the securely walled courtyard garden is not large, it is a good area for children to play in. And you don’t need to worry about packing lots of bulky children’s equipment. We’d be happy to hire any items on your behalf for the duration of your stay (click <a href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf?_ga=2.78765076.181999741.1531707327-1738552978.1503629452" target="_blank">here</a> to see a list of all available hire items). </p><p>The kitchen is fully equipped if you’d like to prepare baby meals or anything for a fussy eater yourself, although the chef will be happy to do this for you. Just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or with the chef, and they’ll take care of the rest. </p><p>Villa Indrani is a convenient five-minute stroll from the beach. While the ocean swell is too heavy for swimming – even for adults ¬– children can splash around more safely in the calmer water in the nearby lagoon, especially on the side closest to the beach.&nbsp; </p><p>Kids and teenagers will love the waterpark slides and the bouncy trampoline centre at Finns Recreation Club , which is a ten-minute walk from the villa. It also hosts the Cubby House Kids Club that offers a huge range of toys and activities to keep children entertained for hours.</p><p>The Bali Equestrian Centre also provides a great day trip for the entire family with pony rides, day camps, lessons, family village tours and beach rides. </p><p>Check out our <a href="./the-locale/things-do-to.html" target="_self">things to do</a> page for these and plenty of other activities in Berawa and the wider Canggu area that will keep the whole family entertained.</p> ]]></Description>
