Just ask our staff to bring the spa  to you. We can recommend deluxe treatments carried out in the privacy  of the villa by fully trained therapists from a reputable local spa  (extra charges will apply).

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Mandalay’s manager will have a wealth of information about  nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any  bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Many of  them live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into  some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.</p> <p>In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.</p> <ol><li>Villa Mandalay is close to the famous temple at <strong>Tanah Lot</strong>  (8km), a beautiful temple set on a rocky, wave battered island just  metres off the beach. In peak season a few too many tourists may  transform a sunset visit into more of a heaving photo opportunity than a  moving experience. Visiting early in the morning (8-9am) provides a  better idea of the power of the location and the chance to see it  undisturbed apart from perhaps an offering ceremony.</li><li>A nice sunset alternative is to head down to <strong>Echo Beach</strong>  (6km) where a number of cafes offer good sunset views and cold beer,  including famous nightly barbecue at Echo Beach House. Note that the  beach here is dark volcanic sand and the waters are better suited to  surfing, having a pronounced swell and rip, rather than children’s  swimming. <strong>Hotel Tugu</strong>, a very stylish and eclectic  boutique hotel a few minutes further down the coast was created by one  of Indonesia’s premier art collectors, and provides a range of  atmospheric dining experiences.</li><li><strong>Horseriding</strong> at Kuda P stables on professionally  trained horses and ponies will take you through the lush rice terraces  around Kerobokan, or provide the chance for a sunset gallop through the  surf along the rugged south-western coast.</li><li>Fashionistas, trendies and shop-a-holics should hot-foot it down to <strong>Seminyak</strong>,  Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave (6km). Here, you can indulge for hours  in the glut of stylish, chic boutiques. There is a wide choice of fine  dining, mid range, and cheap ‘n cheerful restaurants in Seminyak too:  fine dining venues include Sarong, the famous Ku Dé Ta, Mama San, Merah  Putih, La Lucciola, Sardine and Métis.</li><li>Explore the charming <strong>Tabanan regency</strong>, revealing  terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand  beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the  volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan  with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu – one of  Bali’s most important temples.</li><li>Acclaimed as the world’s best, the atmospheric <strong>Elephant Safari Park</strong>  in Taro (north of Ubud) provides a sanctuary for elephants rescued from  Sumatra, with opportunities for trekking, hand feeding, and photo  taking. There is also a fascinating museum and an excellent restaurant  in a beautiful tropical setting deep in the forests of Bali’s  hinterland.</li><li><strong>Bali Treetop Adventure Park</strong> is near the town of  Bedugal in northern central Bali (next to Lake Bratan). Five adventure  circuits, with heights ranging from two to 20 metres, challenge all  level and ages on suspended bridges, spider nets, Tarzan jumps and 12  flying foxes.</li><li>The most exclusive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali trekking tour</span> promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href="http://">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. </a><br /></li><li>Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and rural villages; a great way to <strong>get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali</strong>. Stop off at a local warung (café) to sample some basic Balinese fare or cool off with a cold drink.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ol>]]></Description>
