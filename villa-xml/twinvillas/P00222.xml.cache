      <Description><![CDATA[<p>With its absolute beachfront location, South Villa at Twin Villas Natai is perfectly positioned for enjoying sea swims, kayak paddles or long strolls along Natai’s 10-kilometre length. With just a few neighbouring villas and the nearest resort half a kilometre away, the beach is largely free of other people. Beyond the villa, guests could take a bicycle ride through Natai’s scenic landscape of coconut palms and buffalo fields, charter a yacht to discover the towering limestone islands of Phang Nga Bay, or explore the tropical marine life of the Similan islands on a diving or snorkel trip. There’s no nightlife in the area, but Baba Beach Club (2km) and Iniala Resort (3km) offer cocktails, dinner and good brunches, and the bright lights of Patong Beach and Phuket town are about 50km away. The nearest town, Khok Kloi, has a few shops, banks and cheap local eateries.</p>]]></Description>
