      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The scene: dazzling tropical sunsets, a endless empty beach, the soothing sound of ocean waves, quiet roads wending through coconut groves. The place: Twin Villas Natai, an elegant pair of five-bedroom villas fronting Natai Beach, a spectacular 10-kilometre stretch of sand on the Andaman coast.<br /></p><p>Just 30 minutes from Phuket airport, yet well away from the crowds, Twin Villas Natai is a fresh, crisp and fun holiday retreat that embraces Natai’s pristine seaside setting. Designed with relaxation and flexibility in mind, mirror-image North Villa and South Villa together offer 10 bedrooms and two 12-metre swimming pools. Clever panels at the side of each villa slide open to connect each “twin’s” main pavilion, forming a double-sized living space for twice the fun!<br /></p><p>These bright living and dining areas with their modern guest kitchens are set in high-ceilinged, glass-fronted pavilions to offer superb sea views and ease of access to the stylish pool terraces. To get to the beach it’s just a quick few steps across the villas’ shared lawn, a lush outdoor play area where a swing dangles invitingly from the branch of a mature tree.<br /></p><p>The bedrooms each offer cosy havens, all with ensuite bathrooms and TVs. A mix of king-sized beds, twin beds, bunk beds, and a convertible sofa accommodate up to 22 guests, giving families and groups ample choice for sleeping arrangements. And the bliss of bathing under the glorious tropical sky awaits guests who stay in the four ocean-view bedrooms on the top floors, each with a private outdoor shower.<br /></p><p>Natai Beach is an exclusive getaway on the Phang Nga mainland north of Phuket Island, with just a handful of villas and resorts lining its shores. Kayaking, beach volleyball and cycling are among the activities to enjoy at Twin Villas, while its magical beachfront setting offers a divine venue for a romantic wedding or special event. Adding to Twin Villas’ allure as a luxury retreat is the dedicated team of staff attending to every guest need, including a villa manager and full-time chef.<br /></p><p>Click on these links to find out more about the two stunning villas that make up Twin Villas Natai:&nbsp; five-bedroom <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/twin-villas-natai-north-villa-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_blank" title="Villa North">Villa North</a> and five-bedroom <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/twin-villas-natai-south-villa-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_blank" title="Villa South">Villa South</a>, or visit the Twin Villas Natai website to see how the villas can be combined and connected to meet your personal holiday or event requirements.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>With its absolute beachfront location, Twin Villas Natai is perfectly positioned for enjoying sea swims, kayak paddles or long strolls along Natai’s 10-kilometre length. With just a few neighbouring villas and the nearest resort half a kilometre away, the beach is largely free of other people. Beyond the villa, guests could take a bicycle ride through Natai’s scenic landscape of coconut palms and buffalo fields, charter a yacht to discover the towering limestone islands of Phang Nga Bay, or explore the tropical marine life of the Similan islands on a diving or snorkel trip. There’s no nightlife in the area, but Baba Beach Club (2km) and Iniala Resort (3km) offer cocktails, dinner and good brunches, and the bright lights of Patong Beach and Phuket town are about 50km away. The nearest town, Khok Kloi, has a few shops, banks and cheap local eateries.</p>]]></Description>

The chef at Twin Villas Natai does not simply prepare meals for guests but serves as a personal guide to help you discover the exciting range of Thai flavours.<br /></p><p>Dishes on the villas’ menu can be tailored to suit guests’ flavour preferences and tolerance for spice. Fiery tom yum prawn soup, the rich complexities of hor mok talay (curried fish mousse), the indulgent sweetness of mango and sticky rice, are just a few of the tastes of Thailand to explore. Thai is the focus here, but Chinese and Western selections are also available.<br /></p><p>A chef will arrange to buy provisions for all meals, which are charged at market price plus a 20% handling fee and a government tax. Guests will be asked to provide a float for groceries in advance, and the staff will do the shopping and keep the receipts for reference.

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Private villas make an ideal choice for a family holiday escape, providing exclusive space and facilities and the freedom to explore and relax in privacy. Twin Villas Natai is especially well suited for large or extended families who will relish the care and attention of the friendly staff. Full-time babysitters can also be arranged (for an extra charge).<br /></p><p>The 12-metre pools in each villa are sure to provide hours of fun and relaxation for guests of all ages, and there’s a shallow section for smaller children to enjoy. The large shared lawn offers more space for outdoor games, while the beach beckons just a few steps away. Inside, living areas have a big TV and comfy sofas to rest on, while the sliding doors connecting the two villas offer the chance to double the size of the indoor living space when both villas are booked together. <br /></p><p>Families will delight in dining at Twin Villas, too. Each villa has a well-equipped kitchen for guests to use should they wish, though most are likely to hand cooking duties over to the villa chef, who is available to prepare every meal. Whether the children are thrilled at the chance to try exotic new dishes or prefer to eat their usual comfort foods, the chef is pleased to accommodate requests and customise the menu to ensure every family meal is a happy one. Some delicious Thai dishes that might be unfamiliar to kids at first, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">gai satay</span> (grilled chicken skewers) or <span style="font-style: italic;">pad thai goong </span>(fried noodles with prawn), might just become their favourites!<br /></p><p>Holiday packing doesn’t have to be cumbersome for families staying at Twin Villas Natai. Two high chairs are provided as well as two baby cots and a selection of pool toys. Other items of children’s equipment can easily be hired on your behalf from reputable local agencies, just let us know in advance what’s needed.<br /></p><p>For families wanting to venture beyond the villa and the beach, there are plenty of activities and sights nearby that will delight budding explorers. See our <a href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html" target="_self" title="Twin Villas Natai - things to do">things to do</a> page for a few ideas and be sure to consult with the villa manager for recommended tours and activities.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Twin Villas Natai offers plenty of beachfront activities and entertainment for families and groups. But for those who wish to venture beyond the beach and villas the natural wonders of Phang Nga are within easy reach, and the nightlife, shopping, dining and cultural sights of Phuket Island are just an hour’s drive away. Here are just a few ideas for things to see and do:</p><ul><li>Explore the colourful coral gardens and marine life on a <span style="font-weight: bold;">scuba diving or snorkelling trip to the Similan Island</span>s, a protected archipelago of emerald waters and silken white beaches (open from 15 October to 15 May). </li><li>Discover beautiful <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phang Nga Bay</span>, with its towering limestone islands and floating village. Travel in style aboard a luxury yacht, hire a traditional longtail boat, or go for a guided kayak adventure through sea caves and hidden lagoons. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Play a round or two of golf</span> at Tab Lamu Navy golf course, Mission Hills Phuket Golf Club on the serene east coast of Phuket, or the Blue Canyon Country Club, a former tin mine transformed into two lush 18-hole courses in northern Phuket.</li><li>Sip sundowners or enjoy a Sunday brunch at nearby <span style="font-weight: bold;">Baba Beach Club</span> or indulge in a gastronomic treat with a dinner at<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Iniala resort</span> created by a Michelin-starred chef.</li><li>Discover the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> jungles and mountain landscapes</span> of Phang Nga province, with myriad adventures including day trips to waterfalls, river canoeing, ATV rides, or a walk up to Samet Nangshe viewpoint.</li><li>Take the kids out for a cool waterslide session at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Splash Jungle waterpark </span>near Mai Khao Beach, or go for a wakeboarding session at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anthem Wake Park</span>.</li><li>Experience Thailand’s wildlife the ethical way with a visit to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phuket Elephant Sanctuary</span> or the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gibbon Rehabilitation Project</span>, both charitable rescue foundations for abused and exploited animals.</li><li>Delve into local history and culture with a stroll around<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Phuket Old Town</span>, where streets are lined with charming Sino-Portuguese buildings restored and converted into cafes, boutique shops and art studios. Explore the alleyways to find intriguing wall murals, food stalls serving delicious local fare such as steaming bowls of Hokkien noodles or moo hong (braised pork belly), and hawkers of good-luck amulets and curios. </li><li>Go for some retail therapy (and great bargains!) in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">markets and malls of Phuket</span>, including Patong Beach with its large Jungceylon shopping centre and street bazaars, stylish Boat Avenue near Bang Tao Beach and, in Phuket Town, the bustling Naka Weekend Market, Lard Yai Sunday street market, and Central Festival shopping mall.</li></ul>]]></Description>
