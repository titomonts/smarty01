      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Belong Dua’s manager will have a wealth of information about places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the area too. Most will live nearby and can give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of local Bali life.<br /> <br /> In the meantime, here’s a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of Villa Belong Dua.</p><ul> <li>  Explore the charming <strong>Tabanan regency</strong>, revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the <strong>volcanic lakes </strong>near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu – one of Bali’s most important temples.</li> <li>  Discover the scenic rice-field landscape and rural villages on one of the villa’s <span style="font-weight: bold;">bicycles</span>; a great way to get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali. Stop off at a local <em>warung </em>(café) to sample some basic Balinese fare or cool off with a cold drink.</li> <li>  With its warm seas, almost year-round season, relatively uncrowded beach and reef breaks and suitability for all levels of experience, Bali surfing is world renowned. The beaches around Canggu (11km) are known for their <strong>world-class surf breaks</strong>, offering an exposed reef break with consistent surf. May to October (dry season) is the favoured time for waves.</li> <li>  Ask the villa manager to arrange a dawn <strong>fishing expedition </strong>with one of the local fisherman in his traditional <em>jukung </em>and get the chef to cook up your catch for lunch.</li> <li>  The villa is close to the famous sea temple at <strong>Tanah Lot</strong>. Although renowned for its sunset vistas, going early in the morning provides a better idea of the power of the location and the chance to see it undisturbed, apart from perhaps an offering ceremony.</li> <li>  A nice sunset alternative is to head down to <strong>Echo Beach </strong>where a number of cafés offer good sunset views and cold beer. <strong>Hotel Tugu</strong>, a very stylish and eclectic boutique hotel a few minutes further down the coast is also a good sunset spot. Note that the beach along this section of the coast is dark volcanic sand and the waters are better suited to surfing than swimming.</li> <li>  Fashionistas, trendies shop-a-holics and foodies should hot-foot it down to <strong>Seminyak</strong>, Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave. Here, you can indulge for hours in the glut of stylish, chic boutiques and international restaurants and bars including, Potato Head Beach club, La Lucciola and Bali’s infamously trendy Ku Dé Ta. For furniture, antiques and homeware stores go for a wander around the streets of nearby <strong>Kerobokan</strong>.</li>  <li>  If you are a bold and brave bargain hunter, a spree within the heart of Bali’s bustling provincial capital is an exciting and rewarding experience. Visit the vibrant <strong>Denpasar markets</strong>, where everything and anything is available.</li> <li>  Go horse riding along the sparkling black sands of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yeh Gangga</span> beach (12km) with Bali Island Horse.  This well-run establishment also offers ATV, dirt bike and bicycle tours.  Great for all ages and abilities and particularly beautiful at sunset.</li> <li>  <a href="http://www.pulaugroup.co.id/"><strong>Pulau Dive Charters </strong></a>offers luxury boat charters around the beautiful islands and waters surrounding Bali. They specialise in private fishing, surfing and diving charters and also offer unique personalised day trips to Nusa Lembongan. Perfect for a family day out on the water or with a group of friends.</li></ul>]]></Description>

 Villa holidays are an excellent option for families. Advantages include having access to your own private facilities, such as a swimming pool, living space and gardens, and having the freedom to use them whenever you want.&nbsp; Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is a real plus &ndash; and one that means parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday too.<br />
 <br />
 Villa Belong Dua has a safely enclosed garden with bags of space, a great swimming pool with shallow section, a playhouse with a difference in the <em>jineng&nbsp; </em>rice barn, and a TV/media room complete with childrens&rsquo; games, books and movies.<br />
 <br />
 The team of friendly staff will go out of their way to make children feel as welcome as adults &ndash; whether its baking cookies in the kitchen, organising a tea party in the rice barn or inviting in some local dancers to entertain the troops. Having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost).<br />
 <br />
 Don&rsquo;t worry about packing all that cumbersome kids&rsquo; equipment for your stay. Just let us know what you need, and anything we don&rsquo;t have in-house (villa facilities include a baby cot and highchair) we can hire on your behalf (click <a href="http://www.marketingvillas.com/children's-equipment-for-hire.pdf">here </a>to see list of available hire items).

          <Description><![CDATA[Belong Dua’s <span style="font-weight: bold;">living pavilion</span> is located close to the villa’s entrance, overlooking the garden and pool. Distinguished by a vaulted roof supported by eight wooden pillars, and open on three sides, it is furnished with a huge, comfortable, built-in sofa and a low dining table sourced from a Javanese <span style="font-style: italic;">warung</span> (café), surrounded by floor cushions. A large mirror reflects the sunny garden, and the pavilion is beautifully lit at night. Behind the living pavilion is an air-conditioned <span style="font-weight: bold;">media room</span> which doubles as an office. Furnished with built-in desks and a comfortable brown leather sofa, this room is equipped with a satellite-channel TV, DVD player and iPod dock. <br /><br />The semi-open-air <span style="font-weight: bold;">dining room</span> shares a pavilion with the kitchen, the two rooms are creatively screened from each other with rows of earthenware bottles. The dining room is furnished with an antique table, six chairs and an antique wooden chest on wheels, known as a <span style="font-style: italic;">gerobog</span>, originally used for storing rice. Fascinating maps and prints hang on the walls, and a captivating portrait of an old Indonesian gentleman takes pride of place at one end of the room. This room, which is cooled by ceiling fans and natural breezes, has the provision of electric blinds on its two open sides in case of inclement weather and is equipped with an iPod and dock. A guest washroom is positioned to one side of the dining room. <br /><br />The immaculate polished-concrete <span style="font-weight: bold;">kitchen</span> is fully equipped with a five-burner gas hob, oven, microwave, fridge, and everything else that the cook needs to create delicious meals.]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[The fragrant <span style="font-weight: bold;">landscaped garden</span> at Villa Belong Dua is characterised by mature trees, a velvety lawn and open skies, and is planted with coconut palms, frangipani, lemon and mango trees, pineapple plants, ginger and lemongrass. It is surrounded by a rustic wall crafted from crushed paras stone applied by hand and unpainted. A Balinese temple shrine sits in the north-east corner. <br /><br />The dazzling 20 x 4 metre <span style="font-weight: bold;">swimming pool</span> is the garden’s central feature. The slate-lined pool is presided over by a Buddha head statue; it presents a separate shallow section for children and is bordered by a candi stone deck furnished with one double and two single Sunbrella sun beds. An outdoor pool shower is thoughtfully provided here. <br /><br />Resting beside the swimming pool is an <span style="font-weight: bold;">antique <span style="font-style: italic;">balé</span> gede</span> from Bali’s Gianyar regency. Originally a traditional two-bedroomed family home, this (now open-sided) pavilion comprises twelve wooden pillars which rest on paras stone plinths and support a roof of radiating beam work crowned with alang-alang thatch. Still furnished with the two original timber bed frames, some step stools taken from an old sugar cane press and a prayer table, it’s a perfect spot for couples to enjoy a massage, or just relax with a good book.   ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Belong Dua offers guests total immersion in the beauty of the Bali countryside; an opportunity to gain privileged insights into the Balinese Hindu lifestyle and experience the warm hospitality, history and culture of this unique tropical island.<br /><br />Not so long ago, stone water vessels (<span style="font-style: italic;">belongs</span>) could be found in every Balinese household; used to store water for drinking and washing. These essential household accoutrements are showcased within the grounds of Villa Belong Dua along with a traditional thatched Balinese rice barn from the village; now more often used as a playhouse, but once a symbol of social status indicating the ownership of precious rice-fields.</p><p>Built based on a time-honoured Balinese compound design, Villa Belong Dua offers guests the luxuries of space, comfort and privacy. Two charming bedroom pavilions and open-sided living and dining areas are adorned with black and white prints of rural life, ancient maps of Dutch Batavia and enchanting portraits, and all are encircled by a delightful, mature walled garden planted with mango, lemon, avocado and jackfruit trees. A generous, 20-metre-long swimming pool stretches out alongside an antique <span style="font-style: italic;">balé gede</span> (originally built as a two-bedroom village home). Facilities within the villa include complimentary WiFi internet, LCD screen satellite-channel TVs and DVD players, an iPod with three docking stations, and a well-equipped kitchen.<br /> <br />A team of experienced staff, including a skilled chef, extend their hospitality to guests, providing full housekeeping services and preparing meals from a suggestion menu of Asian and Western fare. The villa manager is also on hand to assist guests and ensure that all expectations are met – if not exceeded.<br /> <br />Belong Dua is located in the charming seaside village of Seseh, home to a revered beach temple where colourful ceremonies are regularly held. A nearby pathway offers walks to the river, rice fields, temple and beach, which is only 300 metres from the villa.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> The fishing village of Seseh grew in importance in 18th century Bali when it became home to the major temple of the former Kingdom of Mengwi. At that time it was also a small trading port, inhabited by a number of families of Chinese decent.<br /> <br /> The village still retains the customs and culture of old Bali. Here, you will see the rice being planted and harvested in the fields, fishing boats returning with the night’s catch, as well as frequent, colourful processions to the large beachside temple.<br /> <br /> Today, Seseh is an ideal destination for those who want to get lost in the beauty of the countryside and engage with the local people to gain privileged insights into the Balinese Hindu lifestyle: the people of Seseh encourage and welcome congenial visitors.<br /> <br /> There are no international restaurants here, but the villa is only 30 minutes’ drive (15km) from the many restaurants and shops of cosmopolitan Seminyak.&nbsp; The renowned surfers’ haunt of Echo Beach is also within easy reach (8.5km by road or just a pleasant 1.5km walk along the beach), where guests can enjoy the laidback vibe, an ice-cold beer or seafood barbecue at The Beach House, and some incredible sunsets.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Accommodation at Villa Belong Dua comprises two bedrooms in stand-alone pavilions named <em>Menaga </em>and <em>Bangkat</em>. These names go back to the time when the village of Seseh was much bigger and administratively divided into <span style="font-style: italic;">banjars </span>or local village councils.<br /> <br /> Each bedroom pavilion features a terrace at the front lit by colonial-style bell-jar lanterns and furnished with an antique daybed. Sliding doors lead into romantic air-conditioned and fan-cooled bedrooms with cream coloured walls, wooden floors and soaring roofs. Each is furnished with a king-size netted four-poster bed backed by terracotta tiling, and equipped with a wall-mounted LCD screen satellite-channel TV, DVD player and iPod dock.<br /> <br /> The delightful air-conditioned ensuite bathrooms are decorated in earthy tones and fitted with a sculptured terrazzo bathtub for two, and double washbasins upon a terrazzo vanity unit which faces a window to ensure plenty of natural light. Glass doors can be opened for a semi-alfresco bathing experience, complete with an outdoor rain shower set in a private walled courtyard with a pebbled floor and a serene Buddha statue. There is also a handheld shower in the bathtub, and a circular skylight that channels the moonshine. Both rooms also feature a spacious dressing room furnished with a wardrobe, chair and dressing table that doubles as a desk.<br /> <br /> An additional single bed with mosquito net can be assembled in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangkat</span> on request.</p>]]></Description>

Open-sided, fan-cooled living and dining pavilions survey the mature tropical walled gardens and pool, either side of which lie the air-conditioned master bedrooms.
