	For a two bedroom villa and a corresponding price we have not seen a bigger garden or pool. The rain showers in the garden bathrooms are large, powerful and bathed in sunshine for total enjoyment. Careful you don&rsquo;t drain all the hot water! This is a really well managed villa. We were so impressed with the chef, the villa manager and his attentive team of very sweet staff.</p>

	Villa Belong Dua sits in a Balinese village street, which is well lit at night, while a nearby pathway offers walks to the river and rice fields. The village of Seseh is quiet, pure, green, and very traditional, with a very strong sense of community. There are no sophisticated facilities in the area, so activities will be limited to walks on the beach (it&rsquo;s not safe for swimming), or gentle hikes through the glorious rice fields. Alternatively, you can join in with some of the village activities, watch the temple processions, or befriend the staff and get invited to ceremonies, and see some dance performances that are not staged for the benefit of tourists. The villagers in Seseh welcome visitors and for the duration of your stay (if you wish) you will be made to feel part of the community.</p>

	For a two-bedroom villa, Belong Dua delighted us with its generosity of space. The sitting room is huge and there&rsquo;s a home theatre as well (a surprise, as this is usually reserved for at least a three-bedder). The garden and pool are also unusually large; the owners could have easily snuck one more bedroom pavilion in, but we are so happy they didn&rsquo;t because it has left a wonderfully open space with wide sky views fringed by coconut palms and towering mature trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	This is a real Bali experience, well away from the fashionable see-and-be-seen caf&eacute; culture of downtown Bali, but still with four-poster beds and gorgeous outdoor bathrooms to rival any of the big boys. When swimming in the pool, make sure you look up at the reflection in the big mirror that sits on the living room wall: the illusion doubles the size of the villa&rsquo;s garden. And when have you ever seen yourself swimming before!? Sunsets on the beach are a short stroll away and do jump on one of the villa&rsquo;s bicycles and head off out among the rice fields to explore the real Bali even further. The area is relatively flat and shady and the local people will never let you get lost.<br />

	This is village life so if the chatter of Balinese children and the crowing of the roosters aren&rsquo;t to your taste it may be a bit much &ndash; we personally found it an enchanting highlight.</p>

    <ROverallComments>The villa is best described as Dr Who's Tardis. We stepped out of  the airport transfer into a back alley and then proceeded to enter a back yard/bike shed that did nothing to appease our apprehension. Then upon the turn of a corner an oasis appeared! The most remarkably kept grounds and tranquil walled setting I have yet to see greeted us along with the smiling faces of the staff who played the most gracious hosts during our stay. The appeal of the villa  along with its ample sized pool kept us confined to its walls purely by choice for the next 24hrs. When we did venture out we were immediately taken in by a true Balinese experience of village life and people hard at work in the surrounding rice fields. When we wished to venture futher afield taxi's were provided within half an hour and with relations made with their drivers further trips were easily planned for the following days with the drivers making the most knowledgeable tour guides. All in all an excellent holiday enhanced by the villa which provides a retreat offering a more  authentic Balinese Experience and just located Far From The Madding Crowd </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We loved the setting and the style of the villa. The garden is simply a paradise. The outdoor areas really relaxed and lovely. Rooms are functional and the little balconies in front of each villa just lovely. We would recommend the villa highly . The only drawback is the traffic - If you get the timing wrong it takes quite some time to Seminyak. The villa is ideal for people who just want to relax in the garden and are not keen on beach and with a pool that size you frankly don't need it. We had a wonderful time. The chef is excellent and we simply enjoyed every dish he cooked - all Indonesian dishes.

    <ROverallComments>Great team of staff led by Arianna who made our stay extremely comfortable. We had private yoga classes in the villa with the perfect setting, as well as private massage by the pool. Location is far from the action in Bali, but the villa was so comfortable that we didn't yearn to spend much time beyond the villa! We will definitely be back!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We (two couples) spent a wonderful week in this beautiful villa in rural surroundings. A better place for relaxation and recreation is hard to find. Everything was up to and some even beyond our expectations, i.e.how our privacy was cherished. The very attentive staff provided us with everything we could request and did so always with a warm smile. All places were properly taken care of, clean, tidy, i.e. fresh towels up to three times a day, chef Franz provided excellent food, all requests were responded in a timely manner.
We wholeheartly can recommend Villa Belong Dua and looking forward to find an opportunity to come back.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Villa belong Dua was exactly what we needed for relaxation and to spend time with our ckildren (3 1/2 and 19 months). The village with no tourists was ideal. The childrens splash section of the pool was perfet and made swimming enjoyable and relaxing for everyone. The gardens were perfect- especially for fairy hunting and flower picking! At first I was concerned about the 2 beedrooms. However, the children were set up in a small room attached to the main bedroom which surpassed my expectations. It meant they were close to us and in the same building, yet we still had privacy. To say the food was great is an understatment- the Chef was excellent and even my fussy girls ate everything up! Staff were very helpful, polite and respected our privacy and independence. I would highly recommend Villa Belong Dua to families wanting to get away from everything, focus on the children and sneak in some adult RnR too!  </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>The villa is stunning and located in a village close to paddy fields so it was lovely to hear the crows of the cockerel in the morning. The pool was warm so it was perfect for our baby to swim in. The chef was great and prepared tasty Indonesian/Balinese as well as Italian meals (his specialty). The staff were friendly. The outdoor shower was simply gorgeous. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The beach is within walking distance but not really suitable for swimming as the waves were pretty strong and there are probably more scenic ones in nearby Seminyak.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We would like to thank you very much for the lovely, tranquil and relaxing 2-week stay we experienced at Villa Belong Dua which is situated in the midst of a very tidy, quaint traditional village. The expansive, immaculate tropical garden and pool allowed us to escape from the everyday hectic of normal life and we thoroughly were able to relax in such lovely surroundings and essentially that is what a holiday should be about. The staff was very friendly and attentive in a discrete way, never obtrusive but quickly available if needed. Thank you for placing all those phone-calls and for the beautiful flower arrangement for our son’s birthday. The magnificent and well-appointed bedrooms and air-conditioned WC and vanity area was well-appreciated as was the gorgeous outdoor shower area. Our special requests for breakfast (chili, tomato and onion omelettes) were always met. The food that Frans prepared was delicious, as was the satay from the lady in Munggu. The attached driver, Made, was excellent, always on time and chauffeured us safely through the maddening traffic of Bali for sightseeing, shopping and to fabulous restaurants in the evenings. All in all, our stay was just perfect. We will surely be back !</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Lovely staff and a relaxing ambience make this a great spot to get away from the world. A short walk to the beach, a shorter walk to a local temple, and surrounded by rice paddies and the ocean, this was a great location to experience Bali in a bygone era. 

Nice to relax in the Bale or read a book in the media room or on the open air pavilion day bad, and simply watch the day pass. Staff were able to arrange in villa massage, a nice start to the day!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Villa Belong Dua is just stunning. The grounds are immaculate and really feels very special having it all to yourself. Loved having our own chef and other staff to look after us! 
The rooms are beautiful and beds very comfortable. Roosters make a lot of noise in the morning but expected this being in a smaller village. We didn't expect the noise from local dogs which was far louder than the roosters and kept us awake most of the first night. Take earplugs with you! Also suggest putting young children in the smaller bedroom as this is not so noisy.
Loved having the option of watching dvd's in the indoor, air-conditioned media room as well as both bedrooms. Outdoor living area is just lovely and a great place to sit and read a book looking over the pool once the kids are in bed.
We all loved the pool which is huge and has a small shallow section for the little kids. Also enjoyed the massage (booked by villa staff at my request) in the poolside bale - cheap too at 110,000 IDR for an hour (about AU$11) - far cheaper than any other villa/hotel we have stayed at in Bali. Kids had lots of fun watching the geckos, lizards and butterflies around the property.
Great having free wifi but found connection quite inconsistent.
Overall we really enjoyed our stay.</ROverallComments>

Located within a Bali Village, with the sights and sounds of village life was unique.  The Villa itself and the staff were fantastic. We look forward to returning soon.  </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>The 3 night break ended up being far too short, but that was our fault! The villa, staff and 'rest factor' were incredible. An ideal small family getaway. Sitting with the (excellent) chef to plan the days menu was a real pleasure as was lounging by the pool and scheduling massages, facials and other delights on a whim. Miles from anywhere else (so not for the clubbers) so a real option for the stressed family needing a recharge. Right in the midst of a Balinese traditional village, but we didn't even hear the chickens start up on the third morning, and that all adds to the charm. We'll be back. Highly recommended!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Villa Belong Dua was amazing.  The property grounds are stunning as is the pool area.  The day bed is an absolute highlight.  We spent hours relaxing on that and it comfortably fit 4 adults and an active 9 month baby.

We loved the property so much that we literally didn't leave except to stock up on drinks at the local shop.  The food prepared by Frans was delicious and I highly recommend the seafood banquet.

There is one area where I believe there could be improvement.  The manager needs to be more pro active in the small things.  An example is that we had to request mosquito coils to be set up every single night.  I would expect things like this to be done without the guest asking for an elite property like this.

I highly recommend this property, we would all love to come back in the future.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Our second visit to this wonderful Villa in Seseh; waking up to the sounds of chickens and pigs; the wonderful Balinese architecture; swimming in the pool; a lovely breakfast; strolling through the village and along the black sand on the beach; bike rides through the rice fields and nearby villages; lunch at the Villa, lounging around the pool, pre dinner drinks and dinner. The fantastic staff including chef makes for a truly restful and enjoyable holiday. We look forward to our next visit!  </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We only stayed four nights at Villa Belong Dua and wished we could extend our stay for much longer. My wife and I have travelled to Bali quite a few times and this villa and its staff are clearly the best we have ever encountered. 
The villa itself is set in a nice and quite gong. The architecture is refined and done with great traditional Balinese taste. Everything about this villa is an invitation to peace and tranquility.
Sainna (not sure this spelled correctly), the villa manager, is very discrete and helpful in making your stay as enjoyable as possible. Francis, the chef, is very friendly and very skilled at preparing all sorts of meals from traditional Indonesian food to more European style cuisine. We strongly recommend you try out the fish BBQ!!!
All in all we had a great stay and bring with us some great memories. We will try our best to come back soon.
Cheers
Felix and Sophie</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We hate to be leaving such a special, beautiful and peaceful place. We enjoyed every relaxing minute, its hard to find a place authentic and truly Balinese as this. The Generosity and kindness of the staff was a gift we especially enjoyed and the amazing dinners prepared by Franz. Long evenings at the dinner table with such delicious food and ice cold Bintang will be a great memory. The peaceful setting and relaxing environment were just what we needed. Thank to everyone for making our stay truly priceless. We hope be back one day soon!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Thank you to all the staff at Villa Belong Dua. You have been very attentive and allowed us to enjoy a relaxing stay. Arya welcome us very warmly and organised everything we asked for with care. Frans and his team created delicious meals that our group appreciated at the times that suited us, including  help with food for a 9 month old baby. We wish the team continued success at this lovely location.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>WOW! What an amazing 3 days at Villa Belong Dua. The Villa itself was spectacular, rustic yet modern, quaint yet spacious and surrounded with lush greenery which blended into our mood.
The staff were equally amazing. We wanted for nothing. We were only here for 3 days, but it felt like more. Special mention to Arya, for being so accommodating and explaining so much to us about Bali. And to Frans, what an amazing chef, our plan was to visit some restaurants in the area for dinner but your food was so good, we couldn't bring ourselves to try something else. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Our stay at villa Belong Dua was great! We stayed four nights and all the staff were extremely  helpful and polite. The pool and villa  stayed very clean and the massage we booked was very enjoyable as well. We ate breakfast at the villa every  morning and it's was very simple but delicious. We request fruits to be served at all times and the lemongrass ice tea is great as well! We ate dinner at the villa and enjoyed the food very much. The manager here is very helpful and listened to all of our requests. I definitely recommend staying at this villa !!!! Thank you.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We had a beatiful time here at Belong Dua and loved the setting. The villa design and serenity of the place. The staff was wonderful and made all our little special wishes come true. Everyone was wonderful and friendly and very special to. Thanks to Nyoman for taking so good and loving care of our two little men! Only downside of our stay is that we probably grew out a bit because of the amazing food!! We would love to be back very soon. Thank you so much for this very special holiday. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We have our excellent stay at villa Belong Dua. The facilties are excellent and have been perfect for our stay. The village is welcoming and there some lovely walks around the area. However the best thing about Villa Belong Dua is the staff. They have been so welcoming and attentive without being intrusive. All the staff have been very professional and have helped so much with our  understanding of local customs and the language. We felt as though we been staying with family. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We enjoyed a wonderful stay in Villa Belong Dua. Architectural details and garden, interior and even more the always humble and helpful staff under Mr Arya made it an unforgettable vacation. The logistics aspect of the organization were even adding to this dreamless-travel experience. We would love to repeat.

    <ROverallComments>We have spent the most gorgeous two weeks here at Belong Dua. It's has been the perfect setting for our family holiday, relaxing, reading and spending a lot of time in the pool. We ate in most days due to our 1 years olds naps and would recommend allowing the chef/team to direct the menu, we had the most delicious Indonesia/Balinese food which we might not have chosen otherwise. Also lunch from a couple of the local warung was a great shout. If you're heading out to Canggu then "the lawn " was a popular choice for us, good pool and beach access and a popular spot for other young families. Also for rusty surfer like us the next door beach "old mans " is good spot to hire boards and get out onto water. Finally a huge recommendation and thank you for the fantastic team here at the villa who are very kind and attentive without being intrusive. Particular praise goes to Wayan for his kindness to our son and his meticulous upkeep of the pool and also to Nyoman. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>The rooms and amenities were absolutely perfect, beautiful outdoor bathroom and shower. The garden and pool are amazing, it's easy to loose a few hours in the tranquility of this. The staff have been wonderful and could not do anything more for us. They have been so friendly and helpful during our stay. The food prepared for us was perfect in all aspects. What more can we say "perfect". I will recommend Villa Belong Dua to our Australian friends. A great destination managed and serviced by great people.

    <ROverallComments>Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. We have enjoyed every minute here at Villa Belong Dua. Our breakfast ,lunch and dinner here very delicious. We were so happy to share a special meals with everyone. The staff is the best we have had on our 3 weeks stay in Bali. The Villa is peaceful and a great Balinese village experience. The sunset on the beach is just a short walk away past the temple and you can see and experience the temple ceremony and blessing. The villa is a green oasis inside of a village around you, lots of butterflies and birds in the villa, that's what we enjoyed.
We loved our experience with the staff and massage in the outdoor area. We can't wait to come back ,we wish our new Bali family much luck and happiness. We will miss you.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We stayed for 9 days at the villa Belong Dua and had the most blissfully time. After stepping out from 25 hours flight and airport journey, we arrive past midnight and we are welcomed with a nice warm meal, cool beverage and a prefect setting. The staff is beyond friendly, attending to every need and proposing ideas of the things to do and see, which key for us as we were mostly here to relax with our 2 years old and hadn't done a lot of research. The  breakfast was scrumptious, the fruits heavenly and the smile of the staff contagious. Nyoman took care of our very picky 2 year old and Arya was always present and available. We highly recorded this villa if your are looking for peace and quiet and a relaxing setting. Bustling Canggu or Seminyak are just cab ride away and once you go, you will be thankful to come back to Villa Belong Dua .

    <ROverallComments>There is limited words I can find to express how we feel after our 10 days at the villa. We came here during one of the most difficult times in life to restore ourselves. We now leave, having not only a great deal of peace but also having found and explored many corners of our lives and hearts as our souls were taken care of in every way imaginable. The villa is perfect and we felt a part of the Balinese tradition which existed long before tourism took over. The food was fresh, exciting and inspiring. We felt part of the family and we will highly recommended the villa.

    <ROverallComments>Someone once quoted that "life is not about the breath you take, but the moments that take your breath". So many moments took our breath away. The small touches made by staff - including Nyoman's home lunch and long chats after dinner. Anything we needed was catered for quickly and without fuss. The area is fantastic to explore or simply stay in the villa for a massage and an afternoon of lounging. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>On behalf of the Shaw family, I want to thank Arya and the staff for their kindness and friendliness during our stay. The villa is beautifully designed and we absolutely loved and spent most of the time in the wonderful pool. We enjoyed our meals and the tranquility of the place and hope to be back again someday. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>My family had a wonderful stay at Villa Belong Dua. The distance from major areas was not a problem at all. Transport was easy to arrange & we LOVED being out of the busy parts of Bali. The village is so charming & the people of Seseh were extremely welcoming. We spent many days not even venturing out of the villa grounds - why would we when we had everything there that we could possibly need? The staff were wonderful & Frans does a fantastic job as chef. The pool is beautiful & the villa is very well maintained. We had friends visit who were staying in Seminyak & they just wanted to leave their villa & move in with us. 
It was all very impressive. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Stayed at a few villas in Bali, lived in Jakarta for 4 years, just to give you background.Rachmat the villa manager is a total standout, charming, thoughtful, creative and responsive to guests needs. He crosses over to the kitchen seamlessly when the cook is not present.He has a history in the service industry in 5 star resorts and it shows.The facilities of the villa are good for the price and a few nice surprises ie ipod docks.Seseh village was very welcoming of guests to their temple ceremonies. Travel back to the tourist belt of Kuta, legian etc is increasing as traffic multiplies each year. However the distance from the tourist belt, insures peace,quiet to explore and wander the local environs.To find a 2 bed stand alone villa of this calibre is a rare find. Respect to tradition was beautifully observed.Thank you for this experience.</ROverallComments>

Can not fault anything. Fantastic food was cooked daily, gardens were immaculate, staff were always ready and eager to help and most friendly. 

I have been to Bali numerous times and this is the place I will go back to next time.

Thanks Rahmat for a great holiday!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>The villa was exactly as described and it more than met our expectations. Comfortable, spacious, incredibly friendly staff, excellent food. The gardens and buildings are well-maintained and it is very easy to get used to having so many people waiting on you hand and foot (that's how it feels!). 

The drive to Seminyak can be slow due to traffic so this villa will be best for people who are happy to stay put. The nearby beach is a bit littered so stick to the pool. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>One of the best places in the world we ever stayed in ! Very high value for money, staff has a high professionel level and tries to please the guest to the most. I can only recommend this to everyone who thinks of staying in the south of Bali, without the hussle and bussle of Kuta or the other southern places. Beautiful place, beautiful people.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We had a wonderful time at Villa Belong Dua - the staff were all fantastic! The only down side (and it was only very minor) were the roosters and dogs barking. But the opportunity to stay in a tranquil village setting far from the hustle and bustle of Kuta and Seminyak more than made up for it!!
Thank-you to everyone involved in organising our holiday - from Nia who booked it, Rahmat, the manager and all the wonderful support staff. You made our stay truly memorable :-)</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Villa Belong Dua was the perfect choice for our family holiday. There were just four of us, 2 adults and 2 children, and this villa accommodated us perfectly. We loved the staff and were very sad to leave them! The design and upkeep of the villa was top notch. We would defintely recommend this to anyone planning a glimpse of the "real Bali". Very well organised, excellent service from BHM and could not fault the whole online booking process. Our stay was most memorable and the best of the three places we stayed in Bali. The food was superb and the pool/massage facilities so relaxing.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Everything about this villa was wonderful. The staff, led by manager Rahmat, were ever attentive but perfectly discreet. The villa is maintained to an exceptional standard, and the grounds and pool are lovely. Franz, the chef, is included in the price and you only have to pay for groceries and any drinks you may consume. We had very relaxing massages and beauty treatments in the antique bale which were also very well priced. Over all, we had a delightful stay, and I just wish it could have been for longer. I only gave the kitchen 9 because we couldn't find the tea!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We have truly loved our stay in this lovely place, the beautiful garden, the quiet location, the excellent facility and most of all the fantastic and glorious staff. Fantastic meals, comfortable rooms with one of the best outdoor showers we have encountered (and we have seen few). All round this has been our best villa experience in Bali. Everybody has gone the extra mile from purchasing us extra drinks to buying my grandchildren DVD's so I could avoid going to seminyak. The massages here are relaxing and I suggest one each day. All meals we had were delicious and one that really stood out for me was the BETUTU, so moist and tender and flavorsome - a must try. Be prepared to be pampered sit back by the stunning pool and just relax.

Staying in this villa is like having a piece of paradise to yourself. In short, it's an amazing place to stay in Bali. The Villa Manager and his team are extremely accommodating and helpful. Chef Putu is a culinary genius and everything he cooks satisfies our tummy well. Thank you for your amazing hospitality. We will meet again soon and for now, goodbye and take care. All the best.

We are very grateful for the amazing food and incredible service during our stay. All the food recommended for each meal are now our favorite dishes.

We're recommended that place for anyone asking for the best in Bali. Thank you for everything.

    <ROverallComments>Our stay in Villa Belong has been like a dream come true, mainly thanks to Arya, Putu and the rest of the staff at the house. The villa has been like a paradise to us, so beautiful, surrounded by beauty, Balinese beauty every where. The team couldn't  have been more professional, kind and warm, definitely above expectation. There permanent smile made our stay. We only can say thank you, a very big thank you to all of them.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>When we arrived at Villa  Belong Dua, we thought what a beautiful place to have holiday and as our stay progressed. We felt at home and that we had been here forever. It's a heaven from the outside world, with a peace that is rarely felt elsewhere. Seseh Village is a lovely place with local people always smiling. Putu, thank you for your fantastic food, chocolate ice cream and stories. To Ketut, Iluh and Nyoman you have looked us so well  always friendly. To Ketut July and Widya thank you for keeping us safe always with a smile. Wayan you do a fantastic job keeping the pool ground so clean. Arya, there no word other than you have been amazing. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support and compassion with Seseh. We will miss Belong Dua very much and look forward to returning soon.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>That's was just fantastic. It was a pleasure to stay in your villa with the prefect staff. All of our wishes have been fullfiled and even beyond that. It was a perfect chill time in our stressful Asia tour and we would love to come back, ASAP! This stay was one of our best tour experiences and we will never forget it.
