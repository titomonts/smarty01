      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Five-bedroomed Villa Gu is a stunning beachside haven, one-minute walk from a gorgeous natural lagoon. Perched between Berawa Beach with its laid-back surfer vibe and Batu Belig with its host of glamorous beach clubs, Villa Gu is situated in one of Canggu’s most sought-after locations. </p><p>Villa Gu is the largest of the three Canggu Beachside Villas, a beautifully designed complex which, together with four-bedroomed Villa Vida and three-bedroomed Villa Boa, can sleep up to 24 guests. Privacy is in no way compromised however, with each villa sweetly secluded within its own extensive walled gardens.&nbsp; </p><p>Villa Gu has an impressive TV and lounge room exquisitely decorated with authentic Indonesian art. Three very spacious master bedrooms, one with a king-size bed and two with split queen-size beds. And two comfortable guest bedrooms with split queen-size beds all feature luxurious ensuite bathrooms. The guest bedrooms are located in a garden annex separate to the main building. </p><p>The beautiful tropical garden and 15 x 4 metre pool, along with spectacular ocean views from the rooftop terrace and the sheer number of outdoor seating areas make this villa a great place for relaxing, socialising or simply hanging out with a good book or a cocktail in hand.</p><p>There’s a small army of staff at your service, including an on-site villa manager, butlers and a housekeeper who will happily tend to your every need, as well as a team of diligent security staff. </p><p>Being so close to many of Canggu and Seminyak’s best eateries means most of our guests prefer to dine out, which is why Villa Gu does not employ a private chef. Should you prefer to have a chef on-site, this can easily be arranged for an additional charge.&nbsp; </p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Your villa manager will have plenty of information about all the places of interest in the area and can arrange transport or make bookings for you. In fact, many of the staff live locally and will be happy to give you some interesting insights into many aspects of Bali life.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of some of the varied activities on offer within easy reach of the villas.</p><ul><li>Enjoy sundowners or an evening meal at <span style="font-weight: bold;">La Laguna</span>, a restaurant and bar entirely made out of driftwood. This is probably the most romantic spot you’ll find on the island, with magical sunset views over the lagoon and the beach. </li><li>Finns Recreation Club ¬– just down the road from the villas – provides hours of <span style="font-weight: bold;">entertainment for the whole family</span>. It has first class facilities including a restaurant, bar and lounge, a library, a kids’ club and a really cool water park. Or visit Finns Beach Club, just 500 metres to the north of La Laguna, and enjoy poolside cocktails in the spectacular bamboo clubhouse overlooking the pool and ocean.</li><li>If you enjoy <span style="font-weight: bold;">eating out</span>, you’ll find some exciting and high-quality choices in the village of Berawa. For breakfast and lunch, head over to Coffee ‘n Oven, which has an excellent choice of European-type pastries. Or try some organic home-grown vegetables underneath the huge tippy-tent at Parachute – only a ten-minute walk from the villas. For dining we can recommend Milu which serves excellent Indonesian and western dishes in a beautiful atmospheric garden, or The Piring Daun for tasty Indian fusion cuisine.</li><li>Children will love hanging out at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Equestrian Centre</span>, a world-class destination for riders and tourists. Its facilities have been designed to accommodate the entire family with pony rides and day camps for the little ones, lessons, family village tours and beach rides. </li><li>Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and nearby rural villages such as Pererenan and Seseh by bicycle; a great way to <span style="font-weight: bold;">get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali</span>. Stop off at a local <span style="font-style: italic;">warung </span>(eatery) to sample some basic Balinese fare.</li><li>The Canggu Beachside Villas are only a 45-minute drive from the famous T<span style="font-weight: bold;">anah Lot sea temple</span>, one of Bali’s most important temples, and also one of its most popular tourist attractions. You can expect a lot of people and camera phones if you visit during sunset, especially during peak holiday season. We advise visiting early in the morning (8-9am) when there are less people and you’ll have a much better chance to really experience the power of this sacred place.</li><li>Play a round at the well-laid out 18-hole <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Beach Golf Course</span> in Sanur or the 85-hectare <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Kuta Golf Course</span> on the Bukit Peninsula, for fantastic ocean views. </li><li>Drive westwards to explore the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan regency,</span> revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned temple – Pura Ulun Danu.</li></ul>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Gu has been cleverly designed with a seamless transition between its indoor spaces and the surrounding gardens. </p><p>The bright and airy lounge is a great example of this, with its floor-to-ceiling windows bringing in plenty of daylight and fresh air. Its dark concrete floors, earthy furnishings and carefully chosen art pieces provide an ingenious contrast with the rest of Villa Gu’s modern minimalist design. </p><p>Taking up almost the entire downstairs space of the main building, the lounge has plenty of comfortable seating, as well as a beautiful corner sofa and a huge flat-screen TV. </p><p>Next to the lounge is a spacious kitchen with all mod cons, including a wine cooler and a microwave. </p>]]></Description>

It also has a 15 x 4-metre private pool and an extensive sun deck with loungers and umbrellas. </p><p>Meanwhile, a large terrace on the first floor and a separate rooftop terrace on the second floor provide excellent views of the ocean and the surrounding rice fields. </p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Gu is located in the village of Berawa on the border between Canggu and Seminyak. Berawa is rapidly becoming a hotspot for surfers who enjoy riding its long beach break, as well with foodies who revel in its dazzling number of coffee shops, delis and restaurants, and shoppers who will enjoy browsing the many boutiques in nearby Canggu.</p><p>The villa is only a one-minute walk from the beach and from a beautiful natural lagoon, where colourful outriggers are pulled up on the sands, ready to head out to sea on their nightly fishing trips.</p><p>To get to the beach you’ll walk past La Laguna, a stunning beach bar and restaurant entirely made out of driftwood, and probably one of the most photogenic spots on the island. From there, take a picturesque stroll along the sand towards other popular surfing spots such as Batu Bolong Beach (3km) and Echo Beach (4km) to the north. The swell is quite strong on this side of the island, so we don’t recommend swimming. </p><p>Walk five hundred metres along the beach to the south and you’ll be able to indulge in the glitz and glamour of some of Seminyak’s most popular beach clubs like Tropicola, W Hotel, Ku Dé Ta and Potato Head. </p>]]></Description>
