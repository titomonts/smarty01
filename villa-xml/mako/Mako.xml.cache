      <Description><![CDATA[<p> The villa manager will typically have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the local area.&nbsp; Invariably some of them will live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.<br /> <br /> In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.</p><ul><li>Catch a wave, or several, at some of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali’s best surfing beaches</span>, only ten to fifteen minutes away.&nbsp; Among the string of naturally beautiful beaches, don’t miss long-time surfers haunt, Echo Beach – but all are in prime position for Bali’s legendary sunsets.</li><li>On Canggu Beach, be sure to visit mystical <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hotel Tugu Bali</span>.&nbsp; Listed in the Robb Report (the World’s Best of the Best), Bali’s first museum-hotel is studded with priceless Indonesian artworks and antiques.&nbsp; The boutique hotel’s award-winning spa offers age-old Eastern therapies.</li><li>Make the de rigueur pilgrimage to sacred <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pura Tanah Lot</span>, one of Bali’s biggest tourist magnets.&nbsp; Perched high on a craggy wave-lashed rock, this ancient sea temple is most popular at sunset, but we suggest guests go early morning to enjoy the location in peace!</li><li>Fashionistas and shop-a-holics should hot-foot it down to Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Seminyak</span>. Here, you can indulge for hours in the glut of stylish, global-inspired restaurants – such as Sarong and Metis, chic boutiques and hipper-than-thou bars on Seminyak beachfront.</li><li>Drive west to explore the unchartered West Bali region, where the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan regency</span> reveals terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black sand beaches dotted with fishing communities – the treasures that Bali is famed for.</li><li>For a day of culture and <span style="font-weight: bold;">dramatic landscapes</span>, head north to Mount Batukaru with its major temple and the nearby rice-fields of Jatiluwih, a UNESCO World Heritage sight; or to the mountain town of Bedugul. From here, explore three volcanic lakes, including Bratan, with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu – one of Bali’s most important temples.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take the villa’s bikes out for a spin</span> and cycle round local villages or down to Pererenan and Echo Beaches.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ubud, the cultural capital of Bali</span>, is around an hour’s cross-country drive away.

The beautiful garden then rolls down to a river located behind its boundary walls. While the delicately crafted gate is an attractive feature in itself, it separates the main house from the pool creating a safety barrier for young children.<br /><br />The 14-metre mango-shaped swimming pool incorporates a large platform (15cm deep) for kids, and is filled with chlorinated water.<br /><br />Sun-seekers will relish the cushioned loungers arranged on the pool’s stone terrace, and a relaxation balé, fitted out in colourful comfort, provides a pleasant shady alternative. Opposite the balé is a barbecue pavilion with a dining table for six, a fridge, and speakers for the sound system. A convenient washroom is situated just behind.    ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[Villa Mako is approached via a private driveway with a secure car parking area. At the villa entrance guests are greeted by a pair of Chinese welcome statues guarding a set of double Balinese doors. The doors open to reveal a covered walkway with a pitched roof, which circumvents an ornamental pond complete with a bubbling water feature.&nbsp; <br /><br />The villa comprises an open-sided fully equipped kitchen and an air-conditioned media room facing each other across the pond while, on the far side, the main building incorporates a living and dining hall and three bedrooms. Beyond the main house, a beautifully landscaped tropical garden, complete with its own serene temple, rolls down manicured lawns to a generously sized swimming pool (with shallow feature suitable for children) and a thatch-roofed dining pavilion. The garden vista flows on to the tropical jungle canopy outside the villa walls and beyond to the surrounding rice terraces creating a picture-perfect backdrop to the serenity of Villa Mako.]]></Description>
