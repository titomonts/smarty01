      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Your Villa Manager or Supervisor will have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any required bookings. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Many of them live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life. In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer on The Bukit Peninsula.</p><ul><li>Soar above the spectacular southern coastline of the Bukit Peninsula on a Paraglider. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Paragliding courses</span> and solo flying for the experienced are available as well as tandem flights in the safe hands of experienced instructors. The training centre is at Timbis Cliff close to the villa.</li><li>At <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Golf and Country Club Nusa Dua</span>, play takes place past creeks, canyons and waterfalls, through a mature coconut grove to the beach and back to the clubhouse alongside a lake. Go for a morning booking to avoid playing in the sizzling midday sun.</li><li>For <span style="font-weight: bold;">shopping</span>, visit Bali Collection, located within the Nusa Dua tourist enclave. The mall is a multi-faceted complex of retail department stores, shops, an art market, and local and international restaurants and bars. If you would prefer to barter for some cheap clothing, check out Nusa Dua’s two tourist markets, one is situated on Jalan Pantai Mengiat (near Mengiat Beach) and the other is close to Melia Bali Resort.</li><li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">seafood feast at Jimbaran Beach</span> is a must for every holiday in Bali. Here, the glorious west-facing beach is home to a plethora of seafood ‘warung’; these simple cafes extend across the length of the beach and serve up the catch of the day, perfect for a sunset dinner. For a more sophisticated experience, relish a sumptuous <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunday Brunch</span> at Boneka at St Regis Resort, Soleil at Mulia, or Prego’s at The Westin.</li>  <li>Perched on a cliff 70m above the roaring Indian ocean, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Uluwatu Temple</span> (Pura Uluwatu) is one of Bali's nine key directional temples. Facing west and with steep headlands on either side creating an unbelievably dramatic setting, sunsets over Uluwatu are a sight not to be missed. Uluwatu is also the place for <span style="font-weight: bold;">surfing</span> enthusiasts. Most of the breaks here are only suitable for advanced or expert surfers - the waves are big here. If you’d rather stay high and dry, stop at Single Fin restaurant on the cliff above to watch the fearless wave-riders performing their moves. Other surf spots on The Bukit include Green Bowl, Dreamland, Balangan, Padang-Padang, and Bingin/Impossibles.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pirates Bay at Nusa Dua</span>, with its pirate ship, tree houses, hanging bridges and little camp sites, kids will jump at the opportunity to be pirates for a day. Older kids, meanwhile, will love Surf &amp; Turf, where beach club meets waterpark with the first flow rider in Bali.</li><li>For <span style="font-weight: bold;">watersports</span>, visit Bali Jet Set Dive and Marine Sports at Tanjung Benoa, which offers everything from wakeboarding, jetskiing, parasailing and kayaking to banana boats and flying fish - a floating bed that gets dragged by a speedboat and flies up in the air – within a safe and eco-friendly environment.</li>  <li>Relax beside the beach or on the cliff at any one of a number of luxurious <span style="font-weight: bold;">beach clubs and day clubs</span>, such as Sunday’s at Ungasan or the adjacent Karma Beach Club; Sunset Beach Bar &amp; Grill at InterContinental Bali Resort; Sundara at Four Seasons Jimbaran; Roosterfish family-friendly beach club at Pandawa Beach; the internationally-branded Nikki Beach Bali at Sofitel Nusa Dua; the Spanish-inspired cliff-front Chiringuito El Kabron and its saltwater swimming pool above a sandy manmade beach; the cliff-top all-day party destination, Omnia, with its modern mega-club vibe; or the spectacular Ulu Cliffhouse – a hedonistic clifftop playground overlooking the waves of Uluwatu.</li><li>Some of the island’s best spas are located on The Bukit.  For a blissful experience, check out the outstanding <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spa Alila Uluwatu</span>, which presents a contemporary spin on ancient Asian healing techniques and Indonesian traditions.</li><li>The golden and white-sand surf<span style="font-weight: bold;"> beaches</span> and coves of the Bukit Peninsula are the most beautiful in Bali. Nyang Nyang Beach is well off the beaten track, reached via a flight of 535 steps, which means it is often deserted. Mengiat Beach, accessible from the road between the Grand Hyatt and Ayodya Resort, is quieter and prettier than Nusa Dua’s public beach; you can rent sunloungers here and there are a few small restaurants. Also well worth a visit are the newly-accessible Pandawa and Melasti beaches, reach via winding roads carved through towering limestone cliffs.</li></ul> ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The southernmost coast of Bali is home to Villa Grand Cliff Nusa Dua, which is tucked into the cliff within the security of The Asmara Estate, just 15 or 20 metres above a honey-coloured beach. The sea is ringed by a coral reef so it is safe for swimming at high tide and offers hours of fun at low tide for the dedicated reef-comber.</p>  <p>Although the environment surrounding the villa is secluded and rural, the five-star resorts, restaurants and shopping facilities at the upscale tourist enclave of Nusa Dua are only five kilometres away, and easily accessible courtesy of your complimentary car and driver.  The villa is a 30-minute drive from Bali’s international airport. </p>]]></Description>
