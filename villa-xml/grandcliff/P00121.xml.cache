      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Your Villa Manager or Supervisor will have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any required bookings. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Many of them live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life. In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer on The Bukit Peninsula and in Jimbaran.</p> <ul><li>Perched on a cliff 70m above the roaring Indian ocean, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Uluwatu Temple</span> (Pura Uluwatu) is one of Bali's nine key directional temples.  Facing west and with steep headlands on either side creating an unbelievably dramatic setting, sunsets over Uluwatu are a sight not to be missed.</li><li>There are two 18-hole golf courses close to the villa. <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Kuta Golf and Bukit Pandawa Golf &amp; Country Club</span> are both situated on the brilliant white limestone cliffs with spectacular views of the Indian Ocean. Try to get a morning booking and avoid playing in the sizzling midday sun.</li><li>From simple local eateries to world-class <span style="font-weight: bold;">fine dining</span> establishments, the Bukit Peninsula presents a wide choice of remarkable restaurants. Opt for top-notch resort dining experiences at the Italian <span style="font-weight: bold;">Il Ristorante at Bulgari Resort</span>, the multi-award-winning <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ju-Ma-Na at Banyan Tree</span>,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Cire at Alila</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sake no Hana</span>, the high-end Japanese restaurant at Omnia. Savour the freshest seafood at the cliff-side<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Kisik Bar &amp; Grill at Ayana </span>(awesome at sunset). </li><li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">seafood feast at Jimbaran Beach</span> is a must for every holiday in Bali. Here, the glorious west-facing beach is home to a plethora of seafood ‘warung’; these simple cafés extend across the length of the beach and serve up the catch of the day, perfect for a sunset dinner.</li>  <li>Uluwatu is the place for <span style="font-weight: bold;">surfing</span> enthusiasts. Most of the breaks here are only suitable for advanced or expert surfers - the waves are big here. If you’d rather stay high and dry, stop at Single Fin restaurant on the cliff above to watch the fearless wave-riders performing their moves. Other surf spots on The Bukit include Green Bowl, Dreamland, Balangan, Padang-Padang, and Bingin/Impossibles.</li><li>At<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Jenggala Keramic in Jimbaran</span>, visitors can browse and buy from a vast range of handcrafted ceramics and glassware.  Jenggala also runs 'Make and Paint a Pot' sessions where 'Children' of all ages are encouraged to get creative.</li>  <li>A two-hour session in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thermes Marins Bali Aquatonic Pool </span>at Ayana Resort is an unforgettable journey through therapeutic jetstreams, microbubbles, water massages and aqua-beds.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Set amid the buzz and activities of prestigious boutique resort, complete with a funicular cabin to transport you to the gorgeous beach and beach club at the base of the cliff, you could be mistaken in believing that you’re not so far from the madding crowd. However, beyond the walls of the Resort in this rural part of Bali’s beautiful and rugged Bukit Peninsula, amenities are few and far between. Therefore, the reasonably day-rate services of the villa’s car and driver are essential if you wish to explore. Some of Bali’s best beaches are easily reached by car, as are some great restaurants, cultural activities, shops, cafes and golf courses.</p>]]></Description>
