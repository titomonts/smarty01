      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Villa Cemara – a magnificent Bali-style residence in Sanur blessed with an amazing 60 metres of absolute beachfront and blissful ocean vistas across the Lombok Straits to the islands of Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan.</p><p>The location is simply incomparable! Imagine slipping through the villa’s private gate, across the golden sand and into the warm shallow waters of the silken sea. Or taking a leisurely stroll (or energetic bike ride) on the adjacent promenade that stretches for eight kilometres along the beautiful south-east Bali coast. </p><p>Designed by famed Balinese architect Popo Danes, Cemara’s five ocean-facing living and sleeping pavilions feature light interiors liberally adorned with finely crafted local materials: alang-alang thatched roofs; Palimanan and terrazzo floors; river-stone walls; elaborately carved and gilded teakwood doors. Artefacts and original paintings by acclaimed Balinese artists grace the air-conditioned bedroom suites, where sublimely comfortable beds dressed in crisp cotton invite restful slumber. </p><p>The enormous open-sided living pavilion is the villa’s social heart – just the spot for casual breakfasts and candlelit dinners prepared by the accomplished villa cook. Choose from an excellent suggestion menu, or take advantage of the abundance of seafood on your doorstep and enjoy grilled fish on the barbecue. </p><p>The entire family will appreciate the cool beach vibe here. Kids can build sandcastles and paddle in the shallow waters; older guests can kite-surf or take to the sea on a jetski. After a refreshing dip in the pool, how about a massage in the balé or in the comfort of your room? At the end of the day, fall asleep lulled by the waves lapping the shore.</p><p>The friendly staff will look after you well, and are happy to organise everything from a gamelan troupe, yoga teacher, or a car and driver for day trips to rice terraces and mountains, Seminyak or Ubud.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by traditional Balinese living, Villa Cemara comprises five alang-alang thatched pavilions, all carefully oriented for the stellar ocean views. A few steps beyond the traditional teakwood entrance doors is the open-sided living pavilion stretching along the beachfront and, across a koi pond to the rear, the villa kitchen. Next along the villa’s 60 metres of absolute beachfront is the 10-metre pool, then the master pavilion and raised corner balé. Looking over the length of the pool and out towards the sea are a pair of two-storey bedroom pavilions, each with two guest suites. A gate between the living pavilion and pool gives direct access to the promenade and beach.</p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>Heliconia, the impressive master suite, occupies a stand-alone alang-alang thatched pavilion adjacent to the beach and separated from the pool area by a water feature. Stepping stones lead to a shaded Palimanan stone terrace where traditional Balinese doors open onto an elaborately carved feature wall running the full length of the suite. A handsome collection of antique furniture and Indonesian art decorate this air-conditioned and fan-cooled space, which is divided into a sleeping section furnished with a king-size bed, and a living area with cane armchairs and a large daybed facing a 42-inch TV. Beyond a wall of glass is a magical rock-garden with pond and waterfall. Out of sight is a dressing room with copious shelving and hanging space. </p><p>Equally impressive is the air-conditioned bathroom with terrazzo twin vanity and, beyond glass doors, a garden courtyard where a jacuzzi is framed by a river-stone wall carved with fish and dotted with birds nest ferns, and an alfresco shower shares space with a water-wall.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Cemara’s manager has a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Chat to the staff too; many have been attached to the villa for some time and are a great source of insider information. In the meantime, here’s a taste of some of the activities on offer within reach of the villa. </p><ul><li>There is a 9-hole <span style="font-weight: bold;">golf course</span> at the Bali Beach Hotel in Sanur, but golf enthusiasts might want to travel further afield to the Bali Golf and Country Club in Nusa Dua for 18-hole courses.</li><li>An annual i<span style="font-weight: bold;">nternational kite festival </span>takes place at Padang Galak beach (just north of Sanur) every July. Traditional Balinese giant kites up to ten metres in length are made and flown competitively by teams from different villages around Bali. Originally, these kites were intended to send a message to the Hindu Gods to create abundant crops and harvests. Aside from the festival itself, visitors will see many giant kites being flown in this area from June through to August.</li><li>Saba Bay <span style="font-weight: bold;">Horse Riding</span> has a special horseriding track (suitable for beginners) on a beautiful black sandy beach overlooking the Indian Ocean and Nusa Penida Island. </li><li>There are several dive operators around Sanur, but this area is more suited to beginners or refresher courses. The better <span style="font-weight: bold;">dive sites</span> are further North in Tulumben, or out on the islands of Nusa Penida and Lembongan.</li><li>Explore Bali’s backroads, lakes, volcanoes, forests and beaches on the back of a Harley Davidson bike with Island Biker Tours. Full day <span style="font-weight: bold;">Harley tours</span>, customised tours or shorter joy rides can all be accommodated.</li><li>If you are a bold and brave bargain hunter, a spree within the heart of Bali’s bustling provincial capital is an exciting and rewarding experience. Visit <span style="font-weight: bold;">Denpasar’s vibrant markets</span>, where everything and anything is available. Pasar Badung, Denpasar’s colourful central market, is the largest and oldest market in Bali. Here’s where the local people shop, and each of the market’s three floors is dedicated to different products. </li><li>Le <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mayeur Museum</span> in Sanur is the former home of noted Belgian impressionist Adrian Jean Le Mayeur. The building is now a museum which, as well as showcasing the artist’s work, gives visitors an insight into what it must have been like to be one of Bali’s very first expats. Although in need of some maintenance, this remains one of Bali’s true hidden treasures.</li><li>From the roaming Sumatran tigers and elephants in the jungle of Sumatra, to the hippos and cheetahs at Lake Manyara, the Safari Journey at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Safari and Marine Park</span> offers a unique adventure. There’s also a Fresh Water Aquarium at the Park, as well as the Hanoman Court, which introduces exotic birds and orangutans, and is the main stage for animal educational and entertainment shows.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Absolute beachfront villas in Bali are few and far between. But holidaymakers seeking a blissful tropical vacation in a luxury villa with a laid-back beach vibe will find that five-bedroom Villa Cemara in Sanur on Bali’s south-eastern coast ticks all these boxes, and more. This private residence rests on 60 metres of beachfront land, with direct access to an expanse of golden sand and shallow, lagoon-like sea.</p><p>Named after the native tree that shades the temple guarding its entrance, Villa Cemara comprises a cluster of one- and two-storey alang-alang thatched pavilions inspired by the compound-style of traditional Balinese family homes and arranged around a 10-metre greenstone-tiled pool. Every room boasts boundless ocean views across the Lombok Strait to the islands of Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan.</p><p>Acclaimed Balinese architect Popo Danes fused the best traditional materials and craftsmanship with contemporary furnishings and facilities to create a gracious, elegant and comfortable home for the villa’s Australian owners, promising days full of magic. Linger over a leisurely lunch prepared by the villa’s cook from an extensive suggestion menu and served in the open-sided living pavilion. Take a siesta on the pool deck, indulge in a massage at the beachfront balé or sink into the black terrazzo jacuzzi in the master pavilion’s private bathroom courtyard. After a candle-lit dinner or fresh-from-the-sea barbecue, retire to your air-conditioned bedroom for a night of sweet, sun-induced slumber. </p><p>Only a 15-minute drive from Bali’s international airport, Villa Cemara is perfect for one or two families or a group of friends seeking tropical open-air living, bags of ‘Bali-style’ character, boundless ocean views and an unbeatable beachfront setting. Along the eight-kilometre-long promenade beyond your private beachfront gate are kite surfing and sea-sports centres, as well as laid-back beach cafés, while some of Sanur’s most notable restaurants, bars, boutiques and galleries are also within easy reach of the villa. But with the villa’s dedicated staff on hand to attend to your every whim, you may be tempted just to stay home!</p>]]></Description>
