      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Kayajiwa’s manager has plenty of information about all the places of interest in the area and can arrange transport or make bookings for you. In fact, many of the villa staff live locally and if you’re interested they will be happy to give you some interesting insights into aspects of Bali life.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of some of the many and varied activities on offer within easy reach of the villa.</p><ul><li>If you’re into <span style="font-weight: bold;">yoga and meditation</span>, you’re only minutes away from The Practice and&nbsp; Serenity, two of Canggu’s most popular yoga studios. Both are based in beautiful bamboo buildings and offer a variety of daily workshops and courses. </li><li>If you enjoy <span style="font-weight: bold;">eating out</span>, you’ll find some exciting and high-quality dining choices in Batu Bolong. For breakfast and brunch there’s Betelnut which has a great selection of hearty vegetarian options, or The Shady Shack if you prefer vegan food. For dining we can recommend Moana Fish Eatery, which serves excellent dishes in a lovely Hawaiian themed atmosphere, or Luigi’s for some top notch Neapolitan pizzas.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Samadi farmers market</span> is just a short walk away. It runs twice weekly, with stallholders from different family-run farms from around Bali. It also has a great mix of local and expat craftspeople offering their wares.&nbsp; </li><li>Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and nearby rural villages such as Pererenan and Seseh by bicycle; a great way to <span style="font-weight: bold;">get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali</span>. Stop off at a local <span style="font-style: italic;">warung</span> (eatery) to sample some basic Balinese fare.</li><li>The most exclusive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali trekking tour</span> promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href=" http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title="Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. ">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. </a><br /></li><li>Villa Kayajiwa is only 10km from the famous sea temple of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tanah Lot</span>, one of Bali’s most important temples, and also one of its most popular tourist attractions. You can expect a lot of people and camera phones if you visit during sunset, especially during peak holiday season. We advise visiting early in the morning (8-9am) when there are less people and you’ll have a much better chance to really experience the power of this sacred place.</li><li>Play a round at the well-laid out 18-hole <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Beach Golf Course</span> in Sanur or the 85-hectare <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Kuta Golf Course</span> on the Bukit Peninsula, for fantastic ocean views. </li><li>Drive westwards to explore the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan regency</span>, revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned temple – Pura Ulun Danu.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa holidays are a great option for families, providing plenty of private and secure space for everyone, and giving guests the freedom to choose what they want to do and when they want to do it. Not having to worry about disturbing other guests is also a plus – creating a more relaxing time for parents and children too. Villa Kayajiwa’s large garden and enormous pool will more than likely keep your children and teenagers entertained for hours. Not to mention the karaoke room! Because of the moat and the prominence of the pool, however, parents with very young children will need to keep a close watch. A pool fence can be hired on request (small extra charge applies). </p><p>You don’t need to worry about packing lots of bulky children’s equipment. We’d be happy to hire any items on your behalf for the duration of your stay (click <a href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf" target="_self" title="children's equipment - elite havens">here</a> to see a list of all available hire items). </p><p>The kitchen is fully equipped if you’d like to prepare baby meals or anything for a fussy eater yourself, although the chef will be happy to do this for you. Just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or with the chef, and they’ll take care of the rest. </p><p>Should you want to explore beyond the villa, be sure to check out our <a href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html" target="_self" title="things to do - Villa Kayajiwa">things to do</a> page.
