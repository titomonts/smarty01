      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine this: Wake to the sound of waves gently breaking on the shore. Yawn, stretch, leap out of bed, fling wide the vast glass doors of your room, and step onto the soft white sand of Lipa Noi Beach. It’s the start of another glorious day at Ban Suriya.</p><p>Suriya means ‘sunshine’ and Ban Suriya has it by the barrel-load. All rooms open up to the light and the warm breeze, and it feels as though the tall palm trees in the garden are part of the house. Ban Suriya’s two swimming pools glitter invitingly, competing with the sea.</p><p>Yes, this delightful Samui villa with its cool white décor punctuated with brilliant splashes of colour is impressive. But much more than that, the scale of its rooms, and its comprehensive facilities, are all about comfort and familiarity. Truly a place to feel at home.</p><p>Six spacious ensuite bedrooms capable of sleeping up 15 people surround the huge central deck, with a well-stocked library, large dining room, computer room, video and games room, and gym in the main building next to the open-air kitchen.</p><p>Seven staff – villa manager, chef, housemaids, gardeners and security guard – ensure every request, every need, is met calmly and speedily, and always with a broad smile.</p><p>Families love this place. Nanny service can be provided and for more grown-up kids there are two canoes and a stand-up paddleboard (what else are beaches for?) There’s also a pool table, a giant chess set, table tennis and a big swing on the beach.</p><p>This Samui villa is also popular for weddings – about 20 are celebrated here every year. Ban Suriya can manage parties of up to 120 people seated for the wedding breakfast.</p><p>Whether you’re starting a life together or enjoying family and friends, Ban Suriya is the place to celebrate. </p>]]></Description>

Arranged around a huge deck within palm-shaded gardens, Ban Suriya consists of a two-storey living pavilion and six supremely comfortable and private ensuite bedrooms. The villa also has its own gym, a spa room, a sunken library with an underwater view into the large infinity-edge pool, an outdoor projector screen and as many TV and video games as you can eat.

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Ban Suriya is Thai for “home of sunshine”. The name could not be more apt. Arranged within a garden of coconut palms and facing the huge pool, all the rooms are encompassed by expanses of glass that can be opened to let the sunshine and light breezes into every space.</p><p>Bordering the gardens of this beautiful Samui villa, and just a few steps from the six bedrooms, is the classic, talc-soft, white tropical sand of Lipa Noi Beach, arguably Samui’s most beautiful and peaceful beaches. Beyond the beach, one’s gaze is drawn to the warm, sapphire-blue sea and the deep blue silhouettes of islands on the horizon; the perfect setting for each evening’s spectacular sunset.</p><p>Ensuring that guests have every opportunity to appreciate the delights of Ban Suriya to the full, the staff of seven seem to be equipped with emotion detectors that tell them what you want before you know it yourself. The chef satisfies your every culinary whim with a tempting array of Thai and international dishes. Indeed, his skills are such that many guests at Ban Suriya opt to dine-in for every meal. </p><p>Between mealtimes, the possibilities for relaxation and holiday pleasure are endless: lounge in or around the pool, play a game of giant chess, pool or foosball, retire to read quietly in the sunken library, work out in the private gym or enjoy a massage in the spa room or beachside tree house. Or take full advantage of the beach and ocean on your doorstep. A doze on a deckchair in the shade, or a quiet paddle in one of the villa’s two kayaks, or atop the stand-up paddleboard. </p><p>After sunset cocktails and a seafood barbecue at the alfresco dining table, gather for a movie at the open-air cinema. The perfect end to another perfect day at Ban Suriya.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Ban Suriya faces west across the sea, it’s elegant sleeping and living pavilions set within palm-tree shaded gardens, oriented around the 20-metre swimming pool. Entering the two-storey, split-level living pavilion, one arrives first in the dining area. To the right are two lounges (one upstairs and one down) and to the front is the well-stocked library. The modern kitchen lies to the left of the dining area. Enormous glass doors open onto a huge wooden deck, the garden and the pool. Four of the villa’s bedrooms face the pool, the fifth is privately positioned at the front of the garden – almost on the beach. Tucked away to the right of the living pavilion, are the sixth bedroom, the games room and the gym.</p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>Ban Suriya’s large, airy, two-storey living pavilion is fronted by huge glass doors looking out onto the gardens and the sea view beyond. Meals are served (unless otherwise requested) at a 12-seat glass-topped table set below a delicate sculpture of a dandelion flower. The room also has a well-stocked drinks fridge and a coffee maker.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;">A few steps from the dining area is the beautifully equipped kitchen, open on two sides and with a huge worktop and stools for casual breakfasts or Thai cooking lessons from the villa’s supremely capable chef. Guests are welcome to cook if they wish – though, understandably, very few choose to do so.</p><p>Down a couple of steps from the entrance hall is the library, with its wide comfortable sofas and a stock of about 300 books. But bookworms may find themselves distracted by the underwater view of the pool through a wide window in the library. </p><p>Next to the dining area, the lower-level lounge is furnished with an armchair and soft sofas, and equipped with a huge TV with DVD player, a satellite TV connection, an iPod dock and an Apple TV 4K box for use by guests who have Apple movie accounts. </p><p>Above the lounge is a mezzanine room of similar size which doubles as a second sitting room or office, with comfortable lounging chairs and a desk for those who simply cannot tear themselves away from their computer. The villa has an iMac computer and a printer at the mezzanine for guest use. WiFi is available in every room and throughout the grounds and onto the beach. Tucked behind the lounge is a spa room, with full bathroom and massage bed. </p><p>The villa’s large gym, with its wall-to-wall glass doors that open onto a metre-deep plunge pool, is well equipped with weights, exercise balls and a punchbag for boxers. Guests can have lessons in Thai boxing, or sessions of yoga, Pilates or other exercise regimes from an expert. Just ask the villa manager to make an appointment for you.</p><p>Next to the gym, the games room has comfortable sofas but – more important for kids – a foosball table along with Wii and PS2 handsets that connect to a huge TV. There’s also a big selection of DVDs, including plenty of children’s favourites.</p> ]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>The villa is arranged around a huge wooden deck with sun loungers for all guests, and a sunken area with a tree-shaded table for alfresco eating. This area can be – and frequently is – used for large weddings or other social events.</p><p>No villa is complete without a pool, and Ban Suriya’s is large and inviting – a blue-tiled infinity-edge delight measuring 20 metres by five. To one side, between the pool and the deck, is a swim-up bar.</p><p>The land Ban Suriya is built on used to be a coconut plantation, and many of the stately trees were preserved, now presiding over the expanse of lawn between the deck and the beach. In one corner is a sacred Tonsai tree while in the opposite corner is the Tree House, the perfect place for an open-air massage or a game of pirates, perhaps.</p><p>For those who just can’t lie in the sun or lounge in the pool all day, the villa has a swing hanging over the beach, a ping pong table, a pool table, and a giant outdoor chess set on an upstairs terrace. For the more energetic there are two kayaks and a stand-up paddleboard.</p><p>And then there’s the beach. Lipa Noi Beach has to be one of the world’s most delightful yet little known tropical gems. Soft white sand with almost no one on it. Warm blue sea with islands in the distance. And at sunset, the perfect venue for a sundowner or two.</p>]]></Description>

This friendly team ensures that guests have everything they want, and never have to lift a finger. Thais have a worldwide reputation for their welcoming character and attentive service. But the level of staff presence is entirely up to you. Would you prefer staff to be around at mealtimes only? Or would you like them to be on hand to serve cold drinks and snacks throughout the day? Just let your villa manager know how much attention you are comfortable with.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Ban Suriya’s chef is on hand throughout your stay to prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner. The villa has an extensive menu of home-cooked dishes to choose from, ranging from Thai and other Asia cuisines to Western favourites, as well as children’s specials and vegetarian choices. Or, off-menu, the chef is always happy to cook up special requests.</p><p>Fish is bought from local fishermen who land their catches on the beach nearby, so it’s always super-fresh. And do please try the villa’s signature Thai dish, <span style="font-style: italic;">Gai Yang Kamin</span> – grilled turmeric-marinaded chicken with a spicy dipping sauce. It’s heavenly.&nbsp; </p><p>Daily breakfast is included in the villa rate. Drinks, along with groceries for the other meals, are charged at market price (plus a 20% handling fee which is subject to service and tax at the prevailing rate) and guests are politely requested to provide the chef with grocery money in advance. Staff will do the shopping and provide receipts for reference. To ensure this can be done in a timely manner, we advise you to plan your meals the evening before.</p>]]></Description>

Follow this with a herbal hot compress treatment, all of which will leave you as relaxed as a strand of al-dente spaghetti.</p><p>Or you can opt for a head and shoulders massage, or a reflexology foot massage. More exotic, our therapists can administer aromatic oil, aloe vera or guasa massages.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Koh Samui is not a big island – it’s just under 230 square kilometres, and much of that is still pristine forest-covered hillside – but it offers a wealth of fun and interesting things to do. Let your villa manager know what sort of activities you’re interested in and he or she will help guide your choices and can also arrange transport to take you there.</p><p>In the meantime, to whet your appetite, here are some suggestions. </p><ul><li>Dusit Deva <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural Centre</span> is a slightly eccentric garden filled with creatures from Buddhist and Hindu myths. Kids will love it.</li><li>Koh Samui has <span style="font-weight: bold;">two golf courses</span>; Santiburi (18 holes and really distracting ocean views), and Bophut Hills (nine holes).</li><li>Treat the family to Sunday Brunch by the pool at the internationally famed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nikki Beach Club</span>, just a few minutes away along the beach.</li><li>Visit nearby Nathon Walking Street <span style="font-weight: bold;">Night Market</span> on Thursdays or the bigger Fisherman’s Village Night Market in Bophut on Fridays.</li><li>Go <span style="font-weight: bold;">island hopping</span>! The Ang Thong National Marine Park encompasses a cluster of islands – the ones you can see from Ban Suriya. The heavily jungled islands are carefully controlled to keep them in pristine natural condition. A trip to them is a must.</li><li>There’s a <span style="font-weight: bold;">kite surfing</span> school on the beach at Nathon where you can rent a rig or learn how to do it.</li><li>Regular<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Thai boxing</span> tournaments are staged at the largest stadium on the island, the Petch Buncha near Chaweng. These are not tourist demo fights; they are the real thing.</li><li>Samui has a number of spectacular <span style="font-weight: bold;">waterfalls</span>. We would recommend starting with the Namuang Falls. Take your bathing costume; there’s a very inviting pool at the base of the falls.</li><li>Have an <span style="font-weight: bold;">adventure </span>atop Khao Pom mountain on ATVs or the zipline, or just gaze out at the scenery below from the viewpoint.</li></ul>]]></Description>
