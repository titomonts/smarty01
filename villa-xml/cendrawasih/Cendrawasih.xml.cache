      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine  staying in the hottest holiday spot in Bali, next to the coolest nightspot and  with your own secret passage to the beach. Rubbing shoulders with the hip Woo  Bar at W Resort and with private access to Pettitenget Beach a five-minute walk  away, the ultra-chic Villa Cendrawasih delivers on all counts. </p><p>In  keeping with its fashionable surroundings, this four-bedroom villa makes quite  a design statement itself, with contemporary furniture, a grey-and-indigo  colour palette and stunning paintings adorning the walls. There’s masses of  entertaining space in the large living and dining room that opens onto the pool.  And for glimpses of the ocean and a ringside seat for Bali’s spectacular  sunsets, guests are quick to head skywards to the rooftop terrace for colorful  cocktails sipped in supine comfort on the turquoise daybeds and beanbags. </p><p>Sunbathe  by the 18m pool? Pump some weights in the air-conditioned gym? Select a move  from the 250-strong digital library and settle down in front of the 55-inch TV  in the media room? Flip through the suggestion menu and let the resident chef  cook up a storm for the evening? Daytime, the only action required of you is  making simple decisions; otherwise, with a full complement of staff including  24-hour butlers attentive to your every whim, you won’t need to lift a finger.  There’s even a driver and car on stand-by for your use at a special rate of US$ 35++ for up to eight hours a day excluding petrol – but as the beach with its panoramic coastline views is  a five-minute stroll away, Bali’s fourth largest temple not much further, and a  proliferation of designer boutiques are within an easy walk, you might not see  so much of him.</p><p>Villa  Cendrawasih takes its name from New Guinea’s birds of paradise– those  remarkable birds known for their spectacular plumage and arresting courtship  displays. It’s certainly the place to indulge in your own romantic rituals, spread  your wings on the beach, or strut your stuff around Bali’s most noted  restaurants and bars – Potato Head, La Lucciola and Ku De Ta  are all within a kilometer away.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[Appropriately named after a bird of paradise, five-bedroomed Villa Cendrawasih presents the modern face of Balinese villas, combining cutting edge design with supreme comfort and the friendliest of staff. Imbued with contemporary sophistication, the villa perfectly reflects it’s setting in Petitenget, a district renowned for hip beach clubs, world-class dining, funky boutiques and cosmopolitan edge. With uber-trendy W Resort right next door, Villa Cendrawasih is in great company.<br /><br />Fresh, crisp interiors incorporate white walls and smooth creamy Palimanan stone floors, accented by warm honey-hued timber, modern impressionist artwork, richly textured furnishings and a smattering of Indonesian ethnic artefacts. During the day the villa provides a chic sunny hideaway where adrenalin junkies can work out in the gym, or swim laps in the 18-metre pool, and those in search of more idle pursuits can indulge in deluxe in-villa spa treatments, watch a movie on the 55-inch HD flat-screen TV, or laze on a sunbed amidst the frangipani trees. Sunsets are best enjoyed from the roof-top terrace with tantalising glimpses of rice paddies, glistening ocean and the island’s towering volcanoes. In the evenings hurricane lanterns softly illuminate the pathways, and a candlelit grand dining table begs for elaborate dinner parties prepared by our talented chef and served by our gracious butlers.<br /><br />For those who manage to tear themselves away from the villa’s soothing environs, a garden door opens onto a secret passageway that emerges on a wide sandy ocean beach (make sure to swim between the flags). Here, casual beach side warungs (restaurants) nestle between famous beach clubs, Mozaic, Potato Head and the glitzy bars and restaurants of W Resort. Jalan Petitenget with its plethora of home stores, bars and restaurants is just one kilometre from the villa.]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Cendrawasih’s manager will have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Many of them live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.</p><p>In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.</p><ul><li>You could eat out at a different <span style="font-weight: bold;">restaurant in Seminyak</span> every night - for months - and still not run out of options. Jalan Laksmana (also known as Jalan Oberoi and Jalan Kayu Aya) is Bali’s fashionable ‘Eat Street’, offering plenty of high-end restaurants including Sarong and Teatro Gastroteque. La Lucciola Restaurant is great for sunset drinks, as is The Woo Bar at W. While Ku Dé Ta is still the place to see and be seen, two newer beachclubs, Cocoon and Potato Head, are classy seaside alternatives. Then there's La Plancha, a rustic beach bar between Double Six and Gado Gado, which is very popular with good tapas, reasonably priced drinks, live music and DJ events. A short taxi ride will bring you to Sardine for elegant seafood, Métis for French Mediterranean cuisine, or to Hog Wild in Bali, famous for barbecue ribs and wicked Martinis.</li><li>Fashionistas, trendies and shop-a-holics should hot-foot it down to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Seminyak</span>, Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave. Here, you can indulge for hours in the glut of stylish, chic boutiques selling designer ware and handcrafted jewellery. Exotic homewares are also a Balinese specialty, from gorgeous hand-crafted ceramics, to embroidered furnishings and all manner of ethnic curios and decorative pieces. </li><li>A nice sunset alternative is to head down to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Echo Beach</span> (8km) where a number of cafes offer good sunset views and cold beer, including the famous nightly barbecue at Echo Beach House. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hotel Tugu</span>, a very stylish and eclectic boutique hotel a few minutes further down the coast was created by one of Indonesia’s premier art collectors, and provides a range of atmospheric dining experiences. Next door to Tugu is the charming Kaki Lima restaurant, a lovely sunset spot with sweeping lawns making it a great place for kids to play. Or try the more casual cafe across the road; Old Man’s for alfresco all day dining.</li><li>Visit the famous <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tanah Lot sea temple</span>. Although renowned for its sunset vistas, going early in the morning provides a better idea of the power of the location and the chance to see it undisturbed, apart from perhaps an offering ceremony.</li><li>Explore the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan regency</span>, revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu – one of Bali’s most important temples.</li><li>Acclaimed as the world’s best, the atmospheric <span style="font-weight: bold;">Elephant Safari Park</span> in Taro (north of Ubud) provides a sanctuary for elephants rescued from Sumatra, with opportunities for trekking, hand feeding and photo taking. There is also a fascinating museum and an excellent restaurant in a beautiful tropical setting deep in the forests of Bali’s hinterland. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Treetop Adventure Park</span> is near the town of Bedugal in northern central Bali (next to Lake Bratan). Five adventure circuits, with heights ranging from two to 20 metres, challenge all level and ages on suspended bridges, spider nets, Tarzan jumps and 12 flying foxes.</li><li>The most exclusive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali trekking tour</span> promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href="http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title="Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. ">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. </a></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and rural villages by bicycle</span>; a great way to get under the skin of the 'real' Bali. Stop off at a local warung (café) to sample some basic Balinese fare or cool off with a cold drink. A number of operators, including Bali Adventure tours offer ‘downhill cycling’ tours starting from the cool climes of Bali’s mountainous hinterland. </li><li>Desa Seni at Berawa Beach is an eco-friendly village resort providing an authentic Indonesian experience through the exploration of culture, art and yoga. The resort offers a wide variety of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yoga classes</span> and also has its own holistic spa and restaurant serving gourmet organic food, most of which is grown in the resorts extensive gardens.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ul>]]></Description>
