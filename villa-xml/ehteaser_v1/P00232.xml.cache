      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Yamu Villa Bua’s chef is a wizard in the kitchen and adept in preparing both Thai and Western cuisine. The villa’s diverse menu features Thai set menu choices as well as the full menu of Ceramic Kitchen, a well-regarded restaurant in nearby Cherng Talay run by a local family who also create a fine range of ceramic décor items in an attached studio. The villa’s wine list draws from the restaurant’s well stocked wine cellar. </p><p>The Thai menu highlights an array of Thailand’s most delectable flavours, with fiery tom yam soup and rich curries among the choices. Ask the chef for any seasonal recommendations and be sure to advise of any particular taste preferences or dietary restrictions among your group.</p><p>The villa’s modern kitchen is a well-equipped and bright space to self-cater, though it’s more likely to be used simply for gathering at the breakfast bar for coffee or as a staging area for cooking demonstrations by the chef on request. </p><p>The menus have fixed prices for set meals and a la carte dishes. Any additional groceries and beverages are charged at market price plus a 20% handling fee and 7% VAT. Guests will be asked to provide money for groceries upfront, and the staff will do the shopping and keep the receipts for reference. To ensure the chef and staff have sufficient time to prepare, guests are encouraged to plan meals at least one day in advance.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>With its ample space, privacy and facilities, Yamu Villa Bua is a superb tropical escape for families. Thailand is a welcoming place for children, and the villa is exceptionally so with its friendly team of staff dedicated to ensuring the kids have sweet memories of their Thai holiday adventure.</p><p>Families can tap into the villa manager’s local expertise to find out the must-see tours and sights to include on their visit as well as suggestions for kid-friendly activities and dining spots beyond the villa. In-villa dining is a breeze with meals that can be planned in advance with the chef, who might even be able to coax the pickiest eaters to try new dishes with all the delicious Thai choices available. Kids tend to love such dishes as pad Thai noodles, satay chicken skewers and tod man goong (fried prawn cakes) with sweet plum dipping sauce. And for families who wish to make their own meals or snacks, the modern guest kitchen is fully equipped and an inviting spot to gather. </p><p>The whole family will enjoy the magnificent 18-metre pool. Pool toys are provided and the dining sala offers a shady spot for poolside drinks and snacks. Young children and toddlers will need to be watched closely, however, since the pool lacks a safety fence. Indoor entertainment includes the ultra-cosy cinema room plus TVs in every bedroom and the family room. </p><p>For adventures beyond the villa, families can stroll down to the small beach in the estate to run around on the spongy sand and build sandcastles. Arrange for the villa’s three standup paddle boards to be brought to the beach for a family paddle along the mangrove-dotted coastline. Active families might want to play a few rounds at the estate tennis court, or spend the day at the COMO Beach Club on nearby Naka Yai Island (day passes available for an additional charge). For further exploration and family-friendly activities, be sure to check our <a href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html" target="_blank" title=" Things to do">Things to do</a> page.</p>]]></Description>
