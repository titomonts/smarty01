      <Description><![CDATA[<p>An ultra-modern, three-level, beach hideaway, the glossy four-bedroom Villa Aqua is enveloped in floor-to-ceiling glass. The style savvy will be immediately drawn to its clean lines, minimalist design and marine-accented theme. </p><p>Set on the exclusive Sava Beach Villas estate<a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas, Natai Beach"></a> just half an hour's drive north of Phuket airport, Villa Aqua is just steps away from Natai Beach – a tourist-free, 10-kilometre stretch of soft white sand backed by a lush rural landscape and a sleepy Thai village. </p><p>Villa Aqua's open-plan L-shaped design creates a generous sense of space.  Tucked away on the lower floor is a large games room with table tennis and a TV/audio system, a TV lounge equipped with a wall-mounted satellite channel TV and a DVD player, a cosy office and a spa room with saunas. A staircase of steel, wood and glass leads up to a bright modern kitchen with bar counter, a dining room with bench seating for eight, a snug media corner stocked with an impressive film and music library, and a large comfortable lounge. Both the lounge and dining areas open widely onto a pool terrace furnished with chic white sun loungers facing the 18-metre swimming pool. An outdoor lounge and barbecue area, poised for sunset cocktails and seafood feasts, complete the many options for relaxed tropical living at Villa Aqua. </p><p>On the top floor of the villa are two splendid king-bedded master suites both offering fine ocean views and bathrooms with indulgent terrazzo tubs. To the rear of the master bedrooms are two guest rooms (both with twins that convert to king size beds). Their shared bathroom makes them ideal for families. </p><p>On hand to guarantee total rest and relaxation for every guest is a villa manager, skilled private chef and housekeeping staff. While the chef will be pleased to tantalise your taste buds with his repertoire of delicious Thai dishes throughout your stay, a stroll down the beach or a short drive will bring you to a choice of local seafood restaurants and fine dining at the Iniala and Aleenta resorts should you crave a change of scenery. Aqua guests also enjoy complimentary use of the estate’s well-equipped gym for workouts with a sea view.</p><p>Click on these links to find out more about seven-bedroomed <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-tievoli-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Tievoli">Villa Tievoli</a>, six-bedroomed <a target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Amarelo" href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-amarelo-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx">Villa Amarelo</a>, <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-cielo-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Cielo">Villa Cielo</a>, <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-essenza-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Essenza">Villa Essenza</a> and <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-malee-sai-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Malee Sai">Villa Malee Sai</a>, and four-bedroomed <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa-roxo-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas - Villa Roxo">Villa Roxo</a> to see how the <a href="http://www.elitehavens.com/sava-beach-villas-villa/natai-beach-phuket-thailand.aspx" target="_self" title="Sava Beach Villas, Natai Beach">Sava Beach Villas</a> can be combined to meet your holiday requirements.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Shush! Don’t tell anyone, but just a 30-minute drive to the north of Phuket airport is a 10-kilometre-long stretch of heavenly white sand. The pristine, near-deserted Natai Beach faces the shimmering waters of the Andaman Sea and is backed by a tranquil rural landscape where buffalo roam and farmers tend their land. It’s in this splendid tropical Thai setting that Villa Aqua brings holiday dreams to life.</p><p>Set just a few steps back from the beach, four-bedroomed Villa Aqua embraces its tropical seaside setting with bright contemporary living space leading out to a large furnished sun terrace and an 18-metre infinity pool. On the ground floor of this fresh, marine-hued, three-storey villa is a TV room, games room, office, and spa area with sauna, steam room and plunge pool. The open-plan living, dining and kitchen lie on the villa’s first floor, facing the pool, and the villa’s four bedrooms – two master suites and two guest bedrooms – are all on the top floor. Three of the bedrooms boast fine sea views.</p><p>Professionally trained staff take care of guests at Villa Aqua. The team includes a villa manager, villa attendants and a skilled Thai chef, all offering attentive personalised service.</p><p>Some of the many natural wonders to explore in the area include Phang Nga Bay, jungle-clad national parks and spectacular waterfalls, while some surprisingly fine dining can be found just minutes away at the Aleenta and Iniala resorts. Airport transfers and private car hire (with driver) can easily be arranged, giving you freedom to explore this beautiful part of Thailand.</p><p>If your holiday dream is to get away from it all, relax with family and friends moments from a beautiful beach, be looked after by caring staff and discover the delights of Thai cuisine, Villa Aqua is the place for you.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Aqua offers plenty to keep families and friends entertained without leaving the luxurious and spacious villa grounds, but the idyllic Phang Nga and northern Phuket area is worth exploring, with some of Thailand’s most breath-taking natural sights, excellent dining and leisure activities within easy reach. And for those in search of a bit more holiday variety, the shopping centres, bars, street markets and notable dining scene on Phuket island are just an hour’s drive away.</p><p>Here’s a selection of some of the places we’d recommend exploring beyond Villa Aqua: </p><ol><li>Unleash your inner Indiana Jones and cool down in a waterfall pool on a mini jungle trek at one of the nearby Phang Nga parks.</li><li>Discover the rich marine life and stunning white beaches of the Similan islands on a snorkelling or diving day trip (mid October to mid May only).</li><li>Bring your camera and explore the coastal roads of the Natai Beach area by bike. Cycle through lush rural landscapes among coconut and banana plantations.</li><li>Charter a luxury yacht or traditional longtail boat for a cruise around Phang Nga Bay and its dramatically steep limestone islands, and don’t miss the chance to do a sea kayak journey through the caves and dreamy hidden lagoons.</li><li>Embark on a gastronomic tour at the celebrated restaurants of nearby Iniala and Aleenta resorts, or try some of the low-key eateries serving authentic Thai fare on the Natai beachfront or in Kokkloy town.</li><li>Treat the family to a soak-and-slide adventure at Splash Jungle on Mai Khao Beach near Phuket airport, or Dino Sea Water Park, just eight kilometres away.</li><li>Take in the inspiring views over Phang Nga Bay with a visit to the stunning Samet Nangshe viewpoint, best seen at sunrise.</li><li>Golf fans can visit two of the area’s top courses in northern Phuket: the Blue Canyon Country Club (23km away) has two 18-hole courses set on 730 lush acres of former tin mine land, and Mission Hills Phuket Golf Club (29km) is an ocean-view Nicklaus Design course on the east coast.</li><li>For some wildlife encounters with an ethical edge, go to the Phuket Elephant Sanctuary, a refuge centre for elephants retired from the tourist trade, or stop by the Gibbon Rehabilitation Project near Bang Pae Waterfall, a rescue and release centre for abused primates and other animals.</li><li>Take a stroll around Phuket Town for its local food, chic cafés, arts and craft studios, street markets and wall murals, and soak up the colourful Old Town atmosphere of the restored Sino-Portuguese buildings and Chinese shrines.</li></ol>]]></Description>
