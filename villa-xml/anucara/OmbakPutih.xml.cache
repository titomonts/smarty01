      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Your villa manager will typically have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Invariably some of them will live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.<br /> <br /> In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of Villa Anucara.</p><ul> <li>  The villa is close to the famous sea temple at <strong>Tanah Lot</strong> (9 km). Although renowned for its sunset vistas, going early in the morning provides a better idea of the power of the location and the chance to see it undisturbed, apart from perhaps an offering ceremony.</li> <li>  A nice sunset alternative is to head down to <strong>Echo Beach</strong> (11km) where a number of cafes offer good sunset views and cold beer. <strong>Hotel Tugu</strong>, a very stylish and eclectic boutique hotel a few minutes further down the coast is also a good sunset spot. Note that the beach along this section of the coast is dark volcanic sand and the waters are better suited to surfing than swimming.</li> <li>  Fashionistas, trendies shop-a-holics and foodies should hot-foot it down to <strong>Seminyak</strong>, Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave. Here, you can indulge for hours in the glut of stylish, chic boutiques and international restaurants and bars including, Potato Head Beach club, La Lucciola and Bali’s infamously trendy Ku Dé Ta. For furniture, antiques and homeware stores go for a wander around the streets of nearby <strong>Kerobokan</strong>.</li>  <li>  Drive westwards to explore the charming <strong>Tabanan Regency</strong>, revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the<strong> volcanic lakes</strong> near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu – one of Bali’s most important temples.</li> <li>  Colourful processions to the beachside <strong>Hindu temple</strong> at the neighbouring village of Seseh (1km walk along the beach) are frequent. On special festival days, thousands of devout Hindus wearing ceremonial dress will converge on this important temple to perform cleansing rituals beside the ocean.</li> <li>  Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and rural villages by <strong>bicycle</strong>; a great way to get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali. Stop off at a local warung (café) to sample some basic Balinese fare or cool off with a cold drink.</li> <li>  With its warm seas, almost year-round season, relatively uncrowded beach and reef breaks and suitability for all levels of experience, Bali surfing is world renowned. Canggu (11km) is known for its<strong> world-class surf breaks</strong>, offering an exposed reef break with consistent surf. May to October (dry season) is the favoured time for waves. Reef breaks provide lefts and rights—in fact, Canggu presents one of the few right-hand waves on the west coast of Bali.</li> <li>  If you are a bold and brave bargain hunter, a spree within the heart of Bali’s bustling provincial capital is an exciting and rewarding experience. Visit the vibrant <strong>Denpasar markets</strong>, where everything and anything is available.</li> <li>  Explore Bali’s backroads, lakes, volcanoes, forests and beaches on the back of a Harley Davidson bike with Island Biker Tours. Full day <strong>Harley tour</strong>, customised tours or shorter joy rides can all be accommodated.</li> <li>  Pulau Dive Charters offers<span style="font-weight: bold;"> luxury boat charters </span>around the beautiful islands and waters surrounding Bali. They specialise in private fishing, surfing and diving charters and also offer unique personalised day trips to Nusa Lembongan. Perfect for a family day out on the water or with a group of friends.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Villa holidays are an excellent option for families, where family-friendly advantages include having access to your own private facilities, such as a swimming pool, living space and gardens, and having the freedom to use them whenever you want.&nbsp; Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is a real plus – and one that means parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday too.<br /> <br /> As well as providing a large garden for running around in and playing hide-and-seek, Anucara has a team of friendly staff who will go out of their way to make children feel as welcome as adults. Having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost).<br /> <br /> Although equipped kitchens allow for easy preparation of meals for fussy eaters or babies, staff will happily to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest. Sausages in the sunken lounge at six? Poolside pancakes for breakfast? No problem a children’s menu is there to help and Ketut, the chef, can customise all meals to suit children’s tastebuds.<br /> <br /> Neither do you have to worry about packing all that cumbersome extra equipment when you stay at Villa Anucara as we can provide you with all the essentials, and more – from pool safety fences to baby baths, cots, high chairs and car seats.

          <Description><![CDATA[Anucara's two master bedrooms are located upstairs in the main building and are both as sleek and sexy  as  each other. Lined with huge blow up images from the owner’s travels  around  Indonesia, each bedroom has white linens, hardwood floors, a  high-pitched  ceiling and wide views of the ocean from not only the  king-size bed and the  stone-paved balcony, but from the bathtub and  shower as well. The bathrooms  carry a nautical theme of seahorse- and  starfish-shaped fittings to complement  the ever-present sight of the  ocean. To the rear of each bedroom, a spacious  dressing areas faces  away from the sea and yields to rice fields and a volcanic  horizon.<br />In  the antechamber between the master bedrooms is a large sitting area  with two  white painted daybeds and a wooden table under a translucent  white skylight.  Glass doors open out to a furnished stone terrace with  ocean and garden views.   ]]></Description>

This room is bathed  in natural  sunlight courtesy of two sets of sliding glass doors, one of  which leads out to  a stone terrace overlooking a manicured lawn and  two very inviting hammocks. A king-size  bed rests on a raised plinth  beneath a stone frieze depicting tropical palm  fronds and frangipani  flowers, while two white leather easy chairs just beg to  be sat upon  and a large white wardrobe provides plenty of storage. A semi-open   outdoor bathroom with monsoon shower and a bathtub invites guests to  experience  bathing under the sun and stars.  ]]></Description>

Two inviting lawn chairs rest on the terrace taking in this   miniature forest setting while, inside, the room is dominated by a  blonde-wood  king-size bed, flanked by wicker lamps and heralded by a  bird carving. Two  similar coloured wardrobes provide storage, while  more tantalising images of  Indonesian island-life adorn the walls. The  open-air bathroom is noteworthy for  its water wall and cleverly  designed, monsoon shower that looks as though it  could be a time portal  to another dimension. ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Villa Anucara offers a helpful suggestion menu featuring Indonesian and international dishes, but guests are encouraged to chat with the cheerful chef about any other fare they would like to try. The chef can competently accommodate special dietary requests and adjust the seasoning of his dishes to suit different palates. This is a good opportunity to explore Balinese dishes such as<em> ayam betutu</em> (chicken stuffed with spices, wrapped in banana leaves and roasted), <em>satay lilit </em>(satay of spiced, minced fish with an infusion of coconut, pressed onto a lemongrass skewer), and <em>pepes ikan</em> (a dish of fragrant spiced local fish, traditionally wrapped and steamed in banana leaf packages and baked). The juices are contained inside the parcel and the experience is an explosion of moist smokey flavour.<br /> <br /> A kids' menu features all the usual children’s favourites, while the dessert menu includes <em>bubuh injin</em> (a sweet and sticky black rice pudding, named after the colour of the rice husk and served with coconut milk sauce).<br /> <br /> Groceries and beverages are charged at cost price plus 20% handling fee which is subject to service charge and government tax. Guests will be requested to provide grocery money in advance, and the staff will do the shopping and keep the receipts for reference. To make the most of the kitchen and give staff time to shop, it is a good idea to plan meals with the staff the evening before. The villa is on the coast so fresh seafood is usually easy to come by (good squid and prawns as well as fish and small lobsters). Meat is sourced from quality suppliers and the chef will buy other ingredients from the market on a daily basis.</p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[The very sociably situated sunken poolside lounge is sure to see a lion’s share of daytime activity. Open on three sides, it features a kitchen area and guest washroom, a wooden bar, antique Indonesian daybeds that serve as tables, bar stools, and wide, built-in sofas with enough seating room for a small army. Above, on the rooftop terrace, daybeds beckon for sunbathing and sunset cocktails. <br /><br />An alfresco dining area sits to the right of the pool between the sunken lounge and a patio area lined with river stones and furnished with two all-weather couches. A ten-seater dining table provides a lovely spot to enjoy dinner after the heat of the day has subsided. <br /><br />The villa’s mature garden stretches for what feels like forever, changing its characteristics as it meanders past the pool and the guest bedrooms towards the property’s boundary. Poolside, sun loungers and two double daybeds are positioned next to mature frangipanis, palms and lilies that pepper the lawns. At the far end of the 35-metre pool the water overflows down a three metre cascade to a smaller pool fronted by two Ganesha (elephant god) statues. Beyond, a ‘wild’ garden of ornamental grasses and white flowering shrubs eventually gives way to a small ‘enchanted forest’ of palm trees and silence.  ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Revealing awesome views of turquoise sea and white-capped waves from its upper floor rooms and terraces, five-bedroom Villa Anucara breathes an ocean-inspired theme in every element of its design. This majestic and contemporary-styled property presents crisp white exteriors and cool cream marble floors, while natural Palimanan stone is the material of the villa’s striking bas-relief murals and impressive Balinese statues, which flank the grand entranceway and border the ponds.<br /> <br /> This pale white stone features abundantly throughout the villa and defines the garden with plump, perfectly placed pebbles and warm textured paving. Even the flowers in the 3300-square-metre garden reflect the foamy surf: all are white, from the sweet-scented snowy blossoms on the many frangipani trees to the softly flowering jasmine that borders the lawns.<br /> <br /> In keeping with the villa’s seaside location, 150 metres from the rugged Cemagi beach, white furnishings are characterised by cheerful cushion fabrics, splashes of blue and turquoise in the ocean-inspired photographic artwork, a dark blue wall, a rustic blue door and tastefully displayed time-worn aquamarine artefacts.<br /> <br /> This gorgeous villa presents two enormous master bedrooms with exotic, tropical, open-air bathrooms, three very private guest suites, a 35-metre swimming pool and a delightful choice of indoor and outdoor living and dining spaces. A large, friendly team of staff is on hand at Villa Anucara to look after every guest need with butler service and superb home-cooking.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Villa Anucara beckons guests with the promise of comfort, privacy, space and fabulous ocean views. With elegant interiors and chic, white-walled, contemporary grandeur, this five-bedroom villa extends into a lengthy garden that offers surprises – a sunken poolside lounge, a rooftop terrace, a 35-metre swimming pool, secluded bedroom pavilions and some enchanting tropical landscaping.<br /> <br /> Located in the seaside village of Cemagi in south-west Bali, a five-minute stroll from the beach and the remarkable sea temple of Pura Gede Luhur Batungaus, this fully staffed, serene villa is encircled by rice fields and wrapped in the arms of traditional Balinese life.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Perhaps the best way to explore this beautiful rural area of Bali is by foot or bicycle (bicycle hire can be arranged); the lanes around Anucara are flat and quiet as long as you steer clear of the main road. Five minutes’ walk up the black-sand beach is the small sea temple of Pura Gede Luhur Batungaus; it sits on a rocky outcrop and is reminiscent of a miniature Tanah Lot, Bali’s most famous sea temple located two or three kilometres further up the coast (9km by road). Heading inland, before you reach the main road, is a village temple and traditional market, where there always seems to be a lot of colourful activity.</p>]]></Description>
