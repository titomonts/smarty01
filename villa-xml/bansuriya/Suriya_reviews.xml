    <RHighlight><p>Almost every aspect of Ban Suriya is a highlight.&nbsp; The bathrooms are certainly worth a special mention thanks to the semi-outdoor designs and indoor landscaping, as are the multifarious, attractively furnished lounge areas (four in all, if you count the one in master suite). The gym annex is a ‘villa within a villa’ and a great option for older kids or singles. Outside, the poolside<span style="font-style: italic;"> sala</span> is an appealing place for drinks and dinner and the tree house is a stroke of genius that will delight kids and adults alike.</p></RHighlight>
    <RSurroundArea><p>
	There&#39;s really very little to pull you away from the facilities and comforts at Ban Suriya. A stroll along the sand provides a sense of the island&#39;s past and the local fishermen and coconut farmers generally go about their business as if you weren&#39;t there.<br />
	<br />
	For a slight variation, a day spent poolside at Nikki Beach, just ten minutes&rsquo; walk away, sipping mojitos and snacking on haute cuisine while listening to the latest dance tunes spun by the resident DJ, makes a nice change (although you can do all that onsite at Ban Suriya). Sunsets from Lipa Noi are some of the best on the island so you can time your indulgences to match the backdrop.<br />
	<br />
	Further afield, the evening food market by the main ferry pier in Nathon offers a buzzing local scene and a sharp but interesting contrast to the island&#39;s more sophisticated side. Lamai (15km) is Samui&#39;s second largest tourist beach and offers all the benefits of an international tourist town with a choice of supermarkets, shops, restaurants and nightlife. But it&#39;s only worth a visit if you crave busier, more commercial surroundings.</p>

    <ROverallComments><p>Ban Suriya is one of those villas where, as reviewers, you find yourself looking for something negative just to tick the ‘Surprises’ box. We failed.<br /><br />Our time passed far too quickly at Ban Suriya.&nbsp; In fact, a month would probably be needed to enjoy the villa to the full. It's not only the salubrious surroundings that stand out, it's the way everything seems to go that extra mile to please.&nbsp; There's not just a computer, there's an iMac packed with tunes that you can play through Bose speakers in the lounge and poolside <span style="font-style: italic;">sala</span> (gazebo).&nbsp; The gym is not only well-equipped, it has a fridge, and a plunge pool bigger than some other villas' main pool.&nbsp; Even the DVD collection includes films you wish you'd remembered to buy at the airport.<br /><br />Ironically, even with so many options we found ourselves drawn to the simplest – the tree house by the beach. The staff is clearly proud to be part of the Ban Suriya experience and the live-in manager was knowledgeable and keen to help us appreciate the villa's pleasures. Although each bedroom is noticeably different, with no one losing out, the master is clearly the most extravagant with its terrazzo bath tub and ensuite lounge. Clever design touches in the guest rooms like direct pool and jacuzzi access, indulgent semi-outdoor bathrooms and hand-picked, stylish furnishings ensure everyone is content, while those staying the twin bedroom by the games room and gym or cosseted in the beachfront pavilion also enjoy complete privacy and independence.<br /><br />Eight people is probably the minimum number you would need to fully appreciate this villa (there's an option to rent four bedrooms outside peak season), otherwise you might struggle to appreciate its exuberance.</p></ROverallComments>
    <RUnpleasantSurprise><p>We found only pleasant surprises, really.&nbsp; Occasional traffic noise from the road behind the villa may worry sensitive souls, but it's only noticeable because the location is so serene.&nbsp; Although Ban Suriya is definitely family-friendly, the ‘floating’ stairs leading to the mezzanine lounge, the sliding doors opening directly to the pool, and the ungated beach access mean it would be wise to keep small children closely supervised.</p></RUnpleasantSurprise>

    <ROverallComments>Can't believe how time just flies in Ban Suriya. The Villa is amazing but what makes it more special is the crew! They are warm and inviting and they treat us like family. They absolutely adore our twins and in return, all of us had a fantastic time. Their attentiveness to all of our requests is incredible. Two thumbs up for the delicious food! We will definitely miss this villa and the most kind and gracious crew, We don't want to go back home. All the best Ban Suriya, keep being special!

    <ROverallComments>Thank you so much for this lovely stay. Tik, Kai, Chef Pueng and all the team - you made us feel better than at home. Every detail was magic - the food was fantastic, the flowers on the bed every night were fabulous, the kids all asked if we could stay here all the time. Hope to see you all next year.

    <ROverallComments>Thank you for all your contribution to our wonderful family holiday. Julie had a fantastic 60th birthday and the special meal you presented to her was outstanding. We could not have selected a better venue and service.
