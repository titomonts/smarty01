      <Description><![CDATA[The family friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want.&nbsp; Villa Hansa is wonderful for families with older children, but those with toddlers will need to be vigilant given the riverside location and the many fishponds and water features.<br /><br />The team of friendly staff at Villa Hansa will make children feel as welcome as adults, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds. If parents require full-time babysitters, the villa manager can arrange for the service at a small extra cost. <br /><br />Although the equipped kitchen allows you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will be happy to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or cooks and they will take care of the rest.&nbsp; Pancakes by the pool for breakfast?&nbsp; Toasties for tea?&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; The chefs will customise all meals to suit children’s taste buds. <br /><br />Don’t worry about packing all that cumbersome kids’ equipment for your stay. Just let us know what you need, and anything we don’t have in-house (villa facilities include a baby cot, highchair and games) we can hire on your behalf (click <a title="Children's equipment - Elite Havens" target="_blank" href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf">here</a> to see list of available hire items).<br /><br />And when the excitement of exploring the villa starts to wear off, check out our <a title="Villa Hansa - things to do" target="_self" href="../the-locale/things-to-do.html">Things to do</a> page – there’s plenty in the area to keep all the family amused throughout the holiday.]]></Description>

 The property&rsquo;s heart, an open-plan and open-sided living pavilion, is edged at the rear by a stunning water-wall feature which provides a constant soothing backdrop.&nbsp; A lounge area on the right is furnished with two white leather sofas and contrasting antique wood chairs and table, all arranged on warm Borneo-wood flooring; Indonesian artifacts, stone statues and vases of exotic blooms add a decorative touch. From the traditional vaulted ceiling hangs a huge lamp made with Tibetan characters encased in shell pieces &ndash; this Tibetan element is a recurring theme throughout Villa Hansa.<br />
 <br />
 The central dining area comprises an expansive table crafted from solid teak wood, seating ten. To the left and on a lower level, the open-plan kitchen is contemporary in style and well equipped; a small guest washroom plus staff quarter&rsquo;s leads off from here.<br />
 <br />
 Being open to the elements, this pavilion doesn&rsquo;t have air conditioning, but is kept cool by ceiling fan and natural breezes; bamboo blinds run along the entire front length, which looks out across the garden and pool. In keeping with the spiritual ambiance of the villa, this pavilion is without a TV or DVD player, but an iPod and dock is provided for musical diversion.</p>]]></Description>
