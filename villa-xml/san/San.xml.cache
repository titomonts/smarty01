 Villa San&rsquo;s manager has a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the local area too. Several of them live nearby and can give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Balinese life.<br />
 <br />
 In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Escape the afternoon heat and watch the antics of the long-tailed macaque monkeys at Ubud&rsquo;s Sacred Monkey Forest. And mind your belongings, these monkeys are skilled pick-pockets!</li>
 <li>
  No visit to Ubud is complete without seeing at least one traditional dance performance.&nbsp; This is a great opportunity to see classic Hindu legends being told through dancers in colorful, Balinese costumes.</li>
 <li>
  The many spas and meditation centres of Ubud offer a wide range of eastern and western therapies from reiki to acupuncture, and yoga to herbal scrubs.</li>
 <li>
  In March, Ubud hosts the Bali Spirit Festival of Yoga, Dance and World Music. Five days of yoga and music workshops, three nights of inspirational world music.</li>
 <li>
  Join amateur and professional artists from around the word, on Wednesday or Saturday morning, for Life Drawing session at Pranoto&rsquo;s Art Gallery opposite Goa Gajah Caves</li>
 <li>
  See some of Bali&rsquo;s best scenery on a daytrip to volcanic Mount Batur. The largest crater lake in Bali fills part of Mount Batur&rsquo;s caldera while small villages cling to the rim. The views from the nearby village of Penelokan are well worth making the trip.</li>
 <li>
  Soar above the spectacular southern coastline of Bali on a paraglider.&nbsp; Paragliding courses, tandem and solo flights are available.</li>
 <li>
  Tour the Karangasem Palace at Amlapura, visited for its unique combination of Balinese, Chinese and European architectures.</li>
 <li>
  Being in the centre of the Island, Ubud isn&rsquo;t the place to base yourself if you&rsquo;re after a beach holiday!&nbsp; But if you fancy a day trip down to the coast, Sanur (25 kms) is probably the best option although Candi Dasa (35 kms) is less crowded. To make a full day of it, drop in at the Bali Marine and Safari Park and the traditional village of Tenganan en route.</li>
 <li>
  Pulau Dive Charters offers luxury boat charters around the beautiful islands and waters surrounding Bali. They specialise in private fishing, surfing and diving charters and also offer unique personalised day trips to Nusa Lembongan. Perfect for a family day out on the water or with a group of friends.</li>

With excellent experience from the Puri Santrian Hotel, Peninsula Hotel and Purmanttur Cruise Ship, the chef is willing and able to accommodate most requests.<br /> <br /> To get the best out of the kitchen, it is a good idea to plan meals with the chef the evening before, or over breakfast, allowing plenty of time for deliveries and shopping to be done. Groceries and beverages are charged at cost price plus 20%++ handling fee (to cover pick-ups/delivery and stock ingredients). Meat is sourced from quality suppliers and other ingredients are bought from the market daily.

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Villa San is a stone’s throw from Ubud’s Royal Palace – where cultural performances are held nightly – and very convenient for many of Ubud’s favourite treasures and attractions. While the property itself is very quiet and private, a vast, bustling local market is only 300m from the front door while a delightful variety of high quality restaurants and cafés can be found in and around the centre of town.<br /> <br /> Ubud and her surrounding small villages are rich with culture and art. Many villages focus on a specific craft – such as woodworking, stone carving, ikat weaving or batik painting. These crafts are not just for the tourists, they have formed the livelihoods of these Balinese villagers for several hundred years. Guests can visit, watch and in many cases take classes – learning to cook local food, carve a wooden mask, dye a batik scarf, dance in a traditional performance, play an ancient brass musical instrument, or attend a life drawing session.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> At the heart of Villa San lies a two-storey living pavilion whose crisp modern lines and eclectic collection of wooden art pieces draw the eye from the moment you step into the villa. The pavilion houses the lounge, dining and entertainment areas as well as a playroom, artist studio, function room and the kitchen. White casual seating, chrome and glass desks and crisp white walls are perfect foil for the exquisite Balinese, Chinese and African handicrafts in bedrooms and living areas.<br /> <br /> The six bedroom suites, all with spacious walk-in wardrobes and luxurious bathrooms, are built in an L-shape around this living pavilion; each a discreet distance from its neighbour.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Pool loungers, hammocks and casual seating shaded by sun umbrellas are comfortably arranged throughout Villa San’s well-kept gardens, while a covered gazebo seating 12-15 lies at the far end of the pool.<br /> <br /> Villa San’s sparkling 25 x 5m pool is just perfect for swimming laps. For lazier times, there’s a lounging ledge at the deep end (1.8m), while the steps at the shallow end (1.3m) are wide and safe for younger swimmers.<br /> <br /> Tucked away in a quiet corner behind the master suite is a tree-shaded terrace for yoga practice, suitable for groups of up to 15 people. Behind it, a traditional stone stupa (a Buddhist meditation building known as the Serene room) offers the perfect place for moments of peaceful reflection.</p>]]></Description>
