      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Where can you find the “real” Phuket, the magical tropical island with lush landscapes, endless ocean views and a traditional way of life? Look no further than Villa Nautilus, a gorgeous five-bedroom escape on Phuket’s east coast that will sweep you away on a voyage of discovery, just like the submarine in the Jules Verne adventure novels that it was named after. </p>Found on a secluded hillside estate in Ao Po, Villa Nautilus inspires dreams of ocean journeys from the moment you arrive and are greeted by the amazing panorama of Phang Nga Bay stretched out before you. The changing colours of the sea and sky, mangrove-fringed beaches where egrets swoop and swirl, the forested hills, and the distant limestone cliffs of seafarer’s dreams form the backdrop to your holiday. And with Ao Po Grand Marina just minutes away from the villa, it’s easy to arrange for your own vessel to sail you away on an exploration of this exquisite seascape. <br /><p>Floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors across the front of the villa offer 180-degree views of this amazing scenery, effortlessly connecting the bright and airy interior living spaces to the outdoor dining and lounging areas. The 25-metre pool with jacuzzi is an enticing spot to enjoy a soak while taking in the views, while those wanting to hone their golf skills can play on the villa’s putting green on the terrace below. And to completely melt any lingering worries away, a massage in the villa’s spa room is a must. A pool table, TV room with built-in speakers and a bar add more playful touches to the villa.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>Families and groups will relish the privacy and comfort of the five bedrooms, each distinctively designed with ensuite bathrooms and a choice of king-sized, queen or twin beds. And no guest will be left wanting with the villa’s team of staff on hand to offer first-class service, including a skilled chef who specialises in Thai cuisine.]]></Description>

One of nine villas on The Estate Beachfront, Villa Nautilus is set on a large hillside plot with views stretching from a mangrove-lined beach below to towering karst islands in the distance.

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Nautilus may be remote from the main tourist areas of Phuket, but there’s plenty to see and do in the area, especially for seafarers. And within a 40-minute drive you can reach Phuket’s better-known beaches, dining spots and leisure activities. Your villa manager will be able to help with bookings and transport, and will have more ideas on what to see and do. In the meantime, here are just a few suggestions: </p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Phang Nga Bay</span> looks enticing enough when viewed from the villa, but its towering limestone islands and calm waters are even more dazzling when seen up close. Charter a yacht to discover the bay in style, or join a sea kayaking tour and paddle through hidden tropical lagoons and caves dripping with sparkling stalactites. <br /></li><li>&nbsp;Much of Phuket’s east coast is a green maze of mangroves and what better way to explore these than with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">standup paddle tour</span>? Paddle Phuket offers day trips for small groups of SUP enthusiasts that take you around scenic inlets and coastlines near Ao Po, with board rental included.</li><li>&nbsp;Enjoy some wildlife encounters the ethical way with a tour of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phuket Elephant Sanctuary</span> or by visiting the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gibbon Rehabilitation Project</span>. Find out more about these organisations’ rescue efforts while watching beautiful creatures go about their day.</li><li>Venture further into the jungle with a mini-trek to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bang Pae Waterfall</span>. The waterfall is in Khao Phra Thaeo National Park, a protected area of pristine tropical forest. Longer hikes to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tonsai Waterfall</span> are possible, though it’s recommended to hire a guide for this one.</li><li>Try a round of tropical golf at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mission Hills</span> – an east-coast golf course with amazing views – or travel a bit further to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Laguna Phuket Golf Club </span>or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Blue Canyon Country Club.&nbsp; </span></li><li>Discover <span style="font-weight: bold;">Koh Yao Noi</span>, an island of scenic rural landscapes and breathtaking coastlines, just a short boat ride from Ao Po. Cycle along quiet roads past buffalo fields and pineapple plantations, have a picnic lunch on a remote beach accessed only by long-tail boat, and learn more about the island’s traditional way of life on a guided day tour. </li><li>Shop and stroll in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phuket’s Old Town</span>, its streets lined with colourful Sino-Portuguese shophouses, tasty local eateries and cute cafes. Stop in at the Thai Hua museum to learn more about the history of the island’s Chinese community, or spend a Sunday evening exploring the weekly <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lard Yai</span> street market, bustling with great local food shops, artists and handicraft sellers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>&nbsp;Enjoy a day on the sand at one of Phuket’s peaceful northern beaches.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Nai Yang</span> is the nearest to the villa, with soft sands to relax on under the shade of casuarina trees and a few beachside restaurants. Standup paddle board rental and kite surfing are among the popular activities, while part of the beach is a protected national park. Go to the northern end of Nai Yang or up to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mai Khao Beach</span> to enjoy some plane spotting, with jets flying in and out of nearby Phuket airport all day, sometimes right over the beach for a dramatic sight!&nbsp; </li><li>Try some wakeboarding at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anthem Wake Park</span>, with cable-ski facilities to suit all ages and abilities as well as an inflatable aqua park for kids to bounce and splash around. Attached to the park is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rebel Rock Climbing</span>, with a well-designed climbing wall offering some fun challenges for those wanting to test their strength and agility. A good rainy-day activity.&nbsp; <br /></li><li>If you love Thai cuisine, you might want to learn how to recreate your favourite dishes so you can enjoy them at home. Thai cookery classes are available at many restaurants and resorts around Phuket, including the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Como Point Yamu</span> resort in Cape Yamu, and at the popular <span style="font-weight: bold;">Suay Restaurant</span> in Cherng Talay, where Chef Tammasak “Noi” Chootong, known for his finesse with Thai and fusion food, shares some of his secrets.</li></ul>]]></Description>
