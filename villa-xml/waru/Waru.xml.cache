      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Waru will surely make you reassess everything you think you know about Bali villa holidays. This extraordinary seven-bedroom villa estate rests on a hilltop in an exclusive gated community above Nusa Dua – a private paradise worlds away from the built-up tourist areas yet less than 15 minutes from the airport. </p><p>The Made Widjaya-designed setting is stunning – mature gardens splashed with technicolour bougainvillaea and tropical blooms, emerald lawns with meandering paths and whimsical statues, and a huge water-garden of interlinking ponds with banks of lotus, koi fish and fountains. Interspersed within this verdant oasis are multiple alang-alang thatched sleeping and living pavilions – among them two air-conditioned living rooms, an upper level open-sided living room, garden living pavilion, yoga and meditation octagon, cellar bar, poolside and water garden bales and two dining terraces each seating up to 14 guests. The seven suites are equally generous, adorned with antique furniture and artwork curated by the well-travelled Asian expat owners who show impeccable taste and an appreciation for the island’s bounteous natural materials.</p><p>The accommodation is grouped into two distinct homes – the four-bedroom Garden Residence, and the three-bedroom Pond Residence, each with their own swimming pool. (Each residence can be rented independently from the other if you don’t need seven-plus bedroom; but they are never rented to two separate groups at the same time, so you will still enjoy complete privacy.)</p><p>With its multiple-pavilion layout and myriad facilities, the fully staffed Villa Waru is perfect for two or three families who love social space and breathing space in equal measure. The place is clearly a much-loved family home, and kids of all ages will be well entertained with the large pool, plunge pool, air-conditioned media room, table football, electronic keyboard and pool table. And for that special family reunion or romantic stop-the-clock wedding, this magical estate is matchless.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Waru stretches across the peak of the Taman Yasa estate, an exclusive enclave wrapping a hilltop above Nusa Dua and Benoa. This elite community of just 21 widely spread out luxury villas promises peace and tranquillity for its residents, who benefit from a guarded entrance gate and 24-hour security patrols, plus the estate’s communal pool and library. The white-sandy beaches of Nusa Dua and Jimbaran are a mere 15 minutes away, as are the shopping centres and restaurants of the myriad five-star resorts lining the shore. And thanks to the new cross-sea tollway at the base of the hill, the journey to the airport, Sanur and attractions further afield is quick and easy.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Waru’s supervisor has a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Chat to the staff too; many have been attached to the villa for some time and are a great source of insider information. In the meantime, here’s a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa. <br /></p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nusa Dua beach</span> is one of the cleanest and longest in southern Bali. Here, as well as enjoying a swim in the calm reef-protected water, you can wind surf, kayak, jet ski and para-sail. Quicksilver run daily tours to Nusa Penida island (world-class diving destination and home of the fabulous mola-mola sunfish) from nearby too.</li><li>For <span style="font-weight: bold;">shopping</span>, visit Bali Collection, located within the Nusa Dua resort enclave. The mall is a multi-faceted complex of retail department stores, shops, an art market, and local and international restaurants and bars. If you would prefer to barter for some cheap clothing, check out Nusa Dua’s two tourist markets, one is situated on Jalan Pantai Mengiat (near Mengiat Beach) and the other is close to Melia Bali Resort.</li><li>At <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jenggala Keramic</span> in Jimbaran, visitors can browse and buy from a vast range of handcrafted ceramics and glassware. Jenggala also runs ‘Make and Paint a Pot’ sessions where ‘Children’ of all ages are encouraged to get creative.</li><li>Soar above the spectacular southern coastline of the Bukit Peninsula on a Paraglider. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Paragliding </span>courses and solo flying for the experienced are available as well as tandem flights in the safe hands of experienced instructors. The training centre is at Timbis Beach on the south coast of The Bukit.</li><li>Perched on a cliff 70m above the roaring Indian Ocean, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Uluwatu Temple</span> (Pura Uluwatu) is one of Bali’s nine key directional temples. Facing west and with steep headlands on either side creating an unbelievably dramatic setting, sunsets over Uluwatu are a sight not to be missed.</li><li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">seafood feast at Jimbaran</span> is a must for every holiday in Bali – dozens of seafood warung (cafés) line this west-facing beach, perfect for a sunset dinner. Fine dining options are available at most of the big resort hotels in this area; notably Sundara at Four Seasons in Jimbaran, the lunch menu here offers wood-fired pizza, sushi and Balinese delights, while the dinner menu presents gourmet steak and seafood selections.</li><li>Uluwatu is the place for <span style="font-weight: bold;">surfing </span>enthusiasts. Most of the breaks here are only suitable for advanced or expert surfers – the waves are big here. Particular highlights are Uluwatu, Dreamland, Padang-Padang, Bingin/Impossibles and Suluban.</li><li>Golfers may wish to play a round at the award-winning 18-hole <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali National Golf Club</span> or the stunning cliff-top Bukit Pandawa Golf &amp; Country Club.</li><li>An annual <span style="font-weight: bold;">international kite festival</span> takes place at Padang Galak beach (just north of Sanur) every July. Traditional Balinese giant kites up to ten metres in length are made and flown competitively by teams from different villages around Bali. Originally, these kites were intended to send a message to the Hindu Gods to create abundant crops and harvests. Aside from the festival itself, visitors will see many giant kites being flown in this area from June through to August.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>We defy you not to be spellbound the moment you walk through Villa Waru’s hand-painted entrance doors into its spectacular gardens. This is a rare chance to experience authentic Bali-style living – where thatched pavilions merge seamlessly with the landscape in pleasing harmony, blurring the boundaries between indoors and out.</p><p>Designed for an international expat family in the 1990s, and updated in 2013, this seven-bedroom villa (comprising two residences and rentable as a three, four or seven bedroom property) rests within enchanting water gardens created by landscaping legend Made Widjaya. Scattered around this sprawling oasis of lawns and lotus ponds, waterfalls and fountains, bougainvillaea and birdsong is a series of living and sleeping pavilions in the style of a traditional Balinese compound, each sensitively placed for verdant views and optimum privacy. The landmark design makes full use of natural materials and local craftmanship: <span style="font-style: italic;">alang-alang</span> thatched roofing, coral limestone and Palimanan stone walls, teakwood and terrazzo floors, elaborately carved traditional doors. Gracing the large, light-filled interiors is a whimsical collection of colonial-era furniture, Asian antiques, artefacts, carpets and curios that reveal the owners’ passion for Bali and shape Waru’s unique personality.</p><p>A much-loved family holiday home, Villa Waru is sure to appeal to kids of all ages. Cool off in one of the two pools, enjoy a massage in the bale, or meditate in the yoga octagon. Play foosball at the poolside, become immersed in a book, board game or film in the TV room, or enjoy a game of pool and some music in the underground cellar bar. Gather in one of the two huge dining terraces for convivial conversation and a gourmet meal prepared by the villa chef. Seek the privacy of your palatial suite for a petal-strewn bath, air-conditioned siesta or blissful night’s sleep. </p><p>With an extraordinary choice of both social and private space, the fully staffed Villa Waru is perfect for a few families holidaying together. It is also a sanctuary for yoga, health and wellbeing retreats, and a spectacular setting for special celebrations and stand-out weddings.&nbsp; </p><p>Villa Waru is hidden away within an exclusive residential enclave high above Nusa Dua in Southern Bali; you can be at the beach in 10 minutes. But we aim to give you little reason to leave our heavenly hilltop haven.</p>]]></Description>

In the centre, an imposing queen-size canopy bed looks onto a teakwood deck suspended above the pond – a private place for reading, relaxing and perhaps an intimate candle-lit dinner for two. A beautifully carved and painted wall panel from a heritage Mandara house opens onto a statue of the Goddess Lakshmi at the entrance to the ensuite bathroom, with twin basins, rain shower and recessed bathtub.</p> ]]></Description>

This really is a wonderland for families, with kid-friendly facilities, and huge grounds with hidden corners to explore. Parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday knowing that the kids can enjoy themselves independently and safely, without the worry of them disturbing other guests.</p><p>Thanks to the configuration of bedrooms in multiple pavilions across the two residences, this is an exceptional villa for a large multi-generation family, or for two or three families holidaying together. There’s plenty to amuse kids, including foosball, pool floats and lots of board games, books and toys. Older kids will relish the pool table in the Indiana Jones-style stone-lined cellar bar.</p><p>While the main swimming pool is a magnet for all ages, parents will have to keep an eye on toddlers – but it’s easy to do so from the comfort of the poolside bale. The same goes for the plunge pool in the Pond Residence where a parent can be sitting in air-conditioned comfort while kids splash around. Those with tiny ones needing more than a high chair and baby cot, click <a href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf" target="_blank" title="here">here </a>to see list of available hire items.
