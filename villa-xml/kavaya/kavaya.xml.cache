      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Kavaya’s manager has plenty of information about local places of interest and tips on where to eat or drink, and can arrange transport or make bookings for you. In fact, many of the villa staff live locally and if you’re interested they’ll be happy to give you some interesting insights into many aspects of Bali life.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of some of the varied activities on offer within easy reach of the villa.</p><ul><li>Villa Kavaya is located next to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Royal Sporthorse Bali</span>, a private stable famous for its ‘natural horsemanship’ philosophy – a way of working with horses based on the animals’ natural instincts and methods of communication. Offering a kids pony camp, as well as village and beach riding tours, it promises a wonderful day out for the whole family. </li><li>Explore the scenic rice paddies of Pererenan and nearby rural villages such as Seseh by bicycle; a great way to <span style="font-weight: bold;">get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali</span>. Stop off at a local warung (eatery) to sample some authentic Balinese fare.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Echo Beach</span> with its dark volcanic sand and casual dining restaurants attracts a laid-back surfer crowd and is ideal for long walks. Due to its strong rip, the ocean is best left to experienced surfers. </li><li>Nearby Jalan Batu Bolong, considered the beating heart of Canggu, will spoil you for choice when it comes to <span style="font-weight: bold;">eating out</span>. For breakfast and lunch, sample the delicious vegan and vegetarian menu at Shady Shack, or indulge in the super-healthy breakfasts and smoothies at Betelnut Café. For dining we can recommend Koi which offers Japanese-style food with a hint of California, or The Slow for a sleek dining experience and delicious cocktails. </li><li>If you fancy a <span style="font-weight: bold;">night on the town</span>, head over to Batu Bolong Beach which in recent years has become a hotspot for the trendy millennial crowd. Don’t be fooled by its name and be sure to visit Old Mans for its infamous Wednesday night party, or enjoy watching a beautiful crowd dance the night away at The Lawn during the weekend. &nbsp;</li><li>Villa Kavaya is a 20-minute drive from the famous sea temple of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tanah Lot</span>, one of Bali’s most important temples, and also one of its most popular tourist attractions. You can expect a lot of people and camera phones if you visit during sunset, especially during peak holiday season. We advise visiting early in the morning (8-9am) when there are less people and you’ll have a much better chance to really experience the power of this sacred place.</li><li>Fashionistas, trendies and shop-a-holics should hot-foot it down to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Seminyak</span>, Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave. Here, you can indulge for hours in the glut of stylish, chic boutiques. There is a wide choice of fine dining, mid-range and cheap ‘n cheerful restaurants in Seminyak. Fine dining venues include Sarong, the famous Ku Dé Ta, Mama San, La Lucciola, Merah Putih, Sardine and Métis.</li><li>Play a round at the well-laid out 18-hole <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Beach Golf Course</span> in Sanur or the 85-hectare <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Kuta Golf Course</span> on the Bukit Peninsula, for fantastic ocean views. </li><li>Drive westwards to explore the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan regency</span>, revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned temple – Pura Ulun Danu.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Kavaya is located on a quiet road alongside two small rivers that meet at the back of the villa gardens in a spot that is sacred to local Balinese people. Listening to the sounds of nature surrounded by lush green countryside, you’ll feel miles away from the hustle and bustle of Canggu. </p><p>There are plenty of great local eateries to choose from in Pererenan, including the charming B’Good Café and the cute Red Salt Café with their excellent breakfast and lunch choices. For dinner, we’d recommend Pescado for sophisticated seafood, or JIB Fusion for tandoori.&nbsp; Other popular surf, dining and party areas in Canggu, like Echo Beach and Jalan Batu Bolong, are less than ten minutes away by car. </p><p>The village of Pererenan is often described as ‘quintessentially Bali’. Surrounded by protected green belt land, endless rice fields dotted with family temples, this area north of Canggu has avoided most of the unbridled development that has affected some other parts of the island. </p><p>The result is a friendly and family-oriented environment that attracts locals, expats and visitors alike with peaceful hillsides, organic markets and secluded beaches. Pererenan has a strong sense of pride in its local environment and is considered a pioneering village when it comes to waste management and recycling.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Kavaya’s private chef curates a menu of gastronomic treats, including home-style Asian and international dishes, and prepares daily breakfast, lunch and dinner. Among the many tempting dishes, be sure to try the chef’s amazing quinoa salad and <span style="font-style: italic;">ikan tuna sambal matah</span> (tuna with fresh sambal). She’s always happy to adapt her meals and take into account additional dietary requirements. </p><p>Groceries and beverages are charged at market price (plus a 20% handling fee which is subject to service and tax at the prevailing rate). Guests will be requested to provide grocery money in advance, and the staff will do the shopping and keep the receipts for reference. To make the most of the kitchen and give staff time to shop, it is recommended to plan meals with the villa manager or chef the evening before.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa holidays are a great option for families, providing plenty of private and secure space for everyone, and giving guests the freedom to choose what they want to do and when they want to do it. Not having to worry about disturbing other guests is also a plus – creating a more relaxing time for parents and children too. </p><p>Villa Kavaya has a very spacious walled garden which is great for children to run around in. It has a well-kept lawn ideal for playing badminton (rackets available), a large 18 x 6 metre pool to splash around in, as well as plenty of nooks and crannies for playtime adventures like hide-and-seek. Older children will no doubt be intrigued by Kavaya’s exotic artefacts, but if you have younger chlldren and are worried about breakages, the villa staff can stow away some of those precious items to protect them from curious little fingers. </p><p>You don’t need to worry about packing lots of bulky children’s equipment. The villa comes with a cot and high chair, but we’d be happy to hire other items on your behalf for the duration of your stay (click <a href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf" target="_blank" title="Children's equipment - elite havens">here</a> to see a list of what’s available). </p><p>The kitchen is fully equipped and you are welcome to use it yourself to prepare meals for babies or fussy eaters, although the chef will also be happy to do this for you. Just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or with the chef, and they’ll take care of the rest. </p><p>Villa Kavaya is located next door to the Royal Sporthorse Bali, a popular stable in Canggu which offers village tours for the whole family and runs a kids pony camp. Children and teenagers will also love the waterpark slides and the bouncy trampoline centre at Finns Recreation Club in Berawa, which is a fifteen-minute drive from the villa. It hosts the Cubby House Kids Club which offers a huge range of toys and activities to keep children entertained for hours.</p><p>Echo Beach and Pererenan Beach are only a fifteen-minute walk away, although bear in mind that the ocean swell is too heavy for swimming – even for adults.&nbsp; </p><p>Check out our <a href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html" target="_self" title="things to do - Villa Kavaya">things to do</a> page for these and plenty of other activities in Pererenan and the wider Canggu area that will keep the whole family entertained.&nbsp; </p>]]></Description>
