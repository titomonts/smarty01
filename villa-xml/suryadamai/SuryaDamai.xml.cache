After work-outs, reward yourself with gourmet goodies at the nearby Deli.</li> <li>  A string of naturally <strong>beautiful beaches</strong>, some renowned for their surf, are all within relatively easy access along this southwest coastline. Nearest is Batubelig Beach, around 10 to 15 minutes by car, but for the area’s premier surf, head to legendary surfer’s haunt, Echo Beach (8km), which also provides handy post-surf sunset drinking. Whichever beach you choose, all are in prime position for fabulous sunsets.</li> <li>  Alternatively, if you want to <strong>learn to surf</strong>, head down to Legian Beach, (25-30 minutes drive) and its Double Six area, home of reputable Rip School of Surf. With the surf school’s long experience and Legian’s manageable waves and sandy bottomed seas, this is a great spot for novice surfers, plus excellent brunches along the beachfront.</li> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Equestrian Centre</span> is conveniently located five kilometres away. Horse lovers will enjoy the extensive facilities on the 300 hectares of pristine rural land surrounded by rice fields and idyllic villages. Take the chance to learn tricks from the experienced and internationally-accredited instructors of BEC.<br /></li> <li>  Built in traditional Indonesian-style, with amazing antique wood dwellings, eco-friendly <span style="font-weight: bold;">Desa Seni Village Resort (</span>a 5-10 minute short-cut through the rice fields or 15 minutes by car) hosts excellent yoga and spiritual workshops in open-air pavilions.

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>
 Villa Surya Damai is a sublime introduction to Bali villa living that will embrace you in its charm and make you never want to leave. Built as a family home this delightful five-bedroom property is uniquely infused with touches of colonial elegance, high-quality interiors and furnishings and all the modern creature comforts required for the perfect tropical villa holiday. Here, classic good taste is mixed with understated simplicity and our ever-happy team of staff are further evidence that this is indeed a relaxed &lsquo;home away from home,&rsquo; welcoming you with a warmth and informal hospitality that will melt away your stresses and tensions.<br />
 <br />
 Set amongst 2,750sqm of mature, riverside gardens overflowing with tropical flora and water features, we designed the villa as a series of charming thatched buildings in the style of a traditional Balinese family compound home. At Villa Surya Damai you will find spacious bedroom pavilions with comfortably furnished private terraces and pretty ensuite garden bathrooms, encircling a welcoming, open-sided living pavilion that faces the centrepiece 18-metre pool. Sun loungers, outdoor and indoor dining areas and an additional lounge/TV room on a wide upstairs veranda, provide more than enough options for both private and social moments. Recreational facilities include three TVs and DVD players, iPod docks and a tennis court.<br />
 <br />
 Beyond the enchanting gardens and across a small river lie terraces of verdant rice fields and a grassy pasture complete with grazing cows. It&rsquo;s a quiet spot where days blissfully blur together. But if you do feel the urge to venture out, the villa is just a three-kilometre drive (or a 20-minute walk) from the beach, as well as lots of world-class restaurants and stylish bars in nearby Petitenget and Seminyak.</p>

<p>
 Bordering a river and the sloping rice terraces in the village of Umalas in south-west Bali, Villa Surya Damai is a serene five-bedroom holiday home of thatched roof pavilions set amidst a vast garden with an 18-metre swimming pool as its centrepiece. Designed like a Balinese family compound Villa Surya Damai is a stunning example of early Bali style, with open-sided living areas and air-conditioned ensuite bedrooms, all mod cons and a tennis court. Great for families and even better for weddings, it comes fully staffed, and is only five kilometres from Seminyak&rsquo;s restaurants, nightlife and the beach.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>
 Villa Surya Damai is located at the edge of the village of Umalas, one of a group of small rural communities that constitute the Kerobokan district, just north of bustling Seminyak. Umalas is home to a growing number of foreign-owned residences and traditional dwellings.<br />
 <br />
 The villa lies off a narrow lane that runs across a small bridge and dissects the rice fields. To the side of the villa, immediately outside the front wooden entrance doors, is a field of grazing cows. A pleasant 20-minute or so walk through farming communities and rice fields brings you to the nearest beach, Batubelig. Great for surfing, this black sand beach, like many along this south-west coastline, has strong currents, so is not advisable for novice swimmers. For surf-patrolled waters and more developed beachside amenities, head south to Legian Beach, seven kilometres away.</p>]]></Description>

 Villa Surya Damai features several <em>alang alang </em>thatch-roofed pavilions generously spread throughout an immaculately landscaped riverside garden.&nbsp; At the centre of the compound, and facing the pool, is an informal, open-sided living room. Stepping-stone pathways set in lush green lawns lead to a master suite, principal guest suite and a double-storey pavilion, containing three bedrooms and a second, veranda-style, living area. Another pavilion, overlooking the swimming pool, houses the formal dining room and adjoining kitchen. A hard tennis court rests in the far corner of the grounds.</p>
