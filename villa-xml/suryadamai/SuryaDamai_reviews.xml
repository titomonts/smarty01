    <RHighlight>Considering the villa was built in 2002 the upkeep and maintenance is exceptional and the staff, many of whom have been there for a number of years, are welcoming, friendly and efficient. All hallmarks of a great villa.</RHighlight>
    <RSurroundArea><p>There is not much in the way of shopping or restaurants in the immediate neighbourhood and for most excursions you will need a car. The good news is that the villa staff can arrange car services plus a driver selected for local knowledge, driving skills and reasonable spoken English. Within ten to fifteen minutes’ drive of Surya Damai are endless dining and shopping opportunities. There are also some rice-field walks worth exploring from the villa which will take you to the beach in under half an hour. Approximately one kilometre from the villa are the well-known Umalas Stables if you fancy a ride through the countryside or along the beach at sunset.</p></RSurroundArea>

    <ROverallComments>Surya Damai was built primarily for the owner’s use and it is clear that they appreciate quality and simple sophistication. There is nothing pretentious, flashy or overdone here. By contrast the villa exudes calm confidence throughout, casually elegant, everything from the colours, furniture, artwork and gardens all fit together effortlessly and draw you deeper into its welcome embrace the longer you stay.<br /><br />If you want to get away from it all, relax and unwind in the blissful knowledge that nothing is too much to ask of the well-trained staff, then this is you. Meals, massages, knowledge of tracks through rice fields to the beach, shopping or making restaurant reservations for dinner are all taken in smiling stride, and if you must connect with the outside world wireless internet and satellite television are available. There is plenty of space for all, relax on a lounger or read a book on a comfortable day bed while children splash in the pool, play on the lawn or wear themselves out on the tennis court.<br /><br />A flick through the guest book confirmed our feeling that the experience regularly surpassed expectations and the hardest part for many guests is saying good bye and returning to the real world.</ROverallComments>
    <RUnpleasantSurprise>There is a small rickety bridge across the river next to the villa which at certain times of the day gets a little bit busy with village motorbikes taking a short cut.<br /><br />Due to a neighbouring property building double storey, the outdoor bathrooms of the two master suites have had the walls heightened with painted metal screens which we were told is a temporary fix. Longer term, tall bamboo or planting would be more in keeping with the villa.<br /><br />We had to chuckle at some of the menu descriptions, had we not been with the children and feeling a bit more romantic the “Lasagne al Porno” may have appealed.</RUnpleasantSurprise>

    <ROverallComments>A stunning traditional balinese property, set in a quiet rural area, giving us solace from the busy streets of Seminyak.  The staff went over and above to make our stay unforgettable.  They were professional and efficient, forever accommodating and friendly.  The food that the chef prepared for us was better than many of the restaurants we tried.  I would have no hesitation in staying at this villa again.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We went to Surya Damai after a glowing recommendation but it still exceeded our expectations.

Even with 7 children between us we managed to have the most relaxing holiday we've ever had.  The house was perfect and the staff were attentive but unobtrusive.  The food was amazing.</ROverallComments>

The food couldn't be faulted, and the grounds and facilities were great for families.  As a family get together it was fantastic, and we all agreed that we would love to return in the near future.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Villa Surya Damai far exceeded our expectations. The villa and staff were exceptional nothing was too much trouble for the truly beautiful staff. They were attentive but in the background and unobtrusive and the villa driver was most patient with us.  :)     I must commend the Villa chef, every meal we had was superb, breakfast was a delight and dinners sublime. The cappuccinos served in the early morning were an added bonus and a lovely surprise (can't start our day without a decent one) the villa itself was outstanding..our family have stayed in several different villas on our many trips to Bali ..but Villa Surya Damai surpasses them all.  Luxury..style..service..complete relaxation...I could go on forever. We were indeed sad to leave this beautiful haven. Thank you for giving us long lasting beautiful memories...we will be back.xx</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Ive been to Bali many times. In addition, I spent a number of year living in the Umalas area. Im very familiar with the benchmarks of what is average, below and above. 

Villa Surya Damai is amazing. The staff are the very best of the best. They are kind, gentle, unobtrusive, professional and so much more. It would be impossible to fault any of them. They are there but they arent there. Its the perfect balance. Anything you need and they have probably anticipated it. You never feel as though they are in your way. I could go on and on about them.... So amazing!

The villa is stunning. The photos do the place very little justice. It is much better in real life. 5 great rooms, 3 of which act as grand master rooms. But really, all of the rooms are great and is suitable for 5 couples or any configuration thereof. 

The living pavilion located in the centre of the grounds is perfectly located and is an amazing chill out area for both day and night for all to hang out in. There are a few other private chillout areas attached to the 3 master rooms which also work for privacy.

Pool area and size is perfect, with really comfortable pool lounges. Great pool towels. 

Bathrooms are great, showers are perfect, everything supplied including soaps and amazing towels. Plenty of towels....... so good!!!

The dining areas is so great. It is attached to the kitchen and functions as the meals area. This naturally raises the topic of meals: 
The cook is 10 out of 10. I do love eating out in Bali. There are so many amazing restaurants. But, having this quality of chef in the house, 80% of our meals were taken in house on this trip!!! 

In a way, I hate making such a glowing review, because next time i go to book, this villa may be rented out by you as a result of reading my review!!! But have to should from the top of the mountain, if you are thinking of going to Bali and considering staying at Villa Surya Damai, do it!!! Every single person in our party of 9 adults were completely blown away by the place.

The location is perfect for those wanting access to both Canggu and Seminyak. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>My whole family had a great time at the villa. We were there for a 3 nights stay and all of us could have just stay in the villa the entire trip! The pool keeps the kids entertained, the food is delicious, the staff are accommodating and always welcoming, the tennis court allows something different to do. Overall, very relaxing and peaceful. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>From the moment we set foot at Surya Damai we were made to feel comfortable. The staff consistently looked after us and never complained about is popping into the kitchen to ask for things when we could have rung the buzzer (which we forgot about). The bathrooms and rooms were beautiful and while the villa is luxurious, it has a lovely lived in feel which made us feel instantly at home. We had a young child with us and he too was well looked after and it was never a problem for him to have his meals at different times to the adults ie, earlier. We all had a great time and didn't really want to go out of the villa while we were there. We ate Indonesian food all week and it was lovely. We will definitely be back and recommend the villa for families and groups without hesitation.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We enjoyed a fantastic holiday at Villa Surya Damai with 2 other families. The staff were welcoming, gracious and considerate. The villa was amazing, beautifully landscaped with plenty of outdoor space for 6 active children. Keep in mind that you may not want to leave the villa to go exploring as it has everything you could ask for. In particular the outdoor bathrooms were incredible. We shall return.... </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We had 3 families staying in the villa who visit Bali several times per year. This was by far one of our best villa experiences. The staff were excellent, always attentive whilst still managing to respect our privacy.Every request we had the staff were able to deliver on (scooters, nannies, drinks, last minute food orders, organising taxis, transfers etc). 
The tennis court was a  great addition to keep the kids active and you don't often find them in villas close to Seminyak. 
The villa was very well kept and the location was so convenient to access nearby cafes, restaurants and shops. 
Two of the bedrooms had an additional lounge room which was excellent for the kids to relax and watch dvds and for the younger children to sleep in with their parents.  We easily accomodated 8 children and 5 adults.
Highly recommend this villa if you want a property that has a lot of open space and beautiful gardens but also has great proximity to the beach and all that Seminyak/Pettitenget has to offer. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Thank you for helping me celebrate my 60th birthday with my family. We were looked after so well in this beautiful villa. Nothing was too much trouble and you quietly went about providing everything we needed. Wayan and the owner should be very proud of their staff. Thank you Chef for wonderful food and adapting to our food requirements. We all had wonderful and relaxing stay at the villa.

    <ROverallComments>We were impressed with the villa and beautiful service from the second we walked in. The immaculate grounds, pool, our rooms and common rooms were always perfect. We enjoyed many meals in the villa, the traditional Indonesian food and the hash browns were a hit! Most of all, the smiling faces of the staff made our stay so special. We can't wait to come back and stay here on our sixth visit, this is easily our favorite villa we've stay in.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We cannot fault the villa or the staff in any way. The villa had the original Balinese charm with all the contemporary luxuries.  The staff were polite, helpful and discrete.  We were treated as kings and queens and nothing was too much trouble. The gardens were beautifully kept and the pool water was pristine.  We had been hoping to be by the beach but now we have had views of the rice paddies this will be our prefered option in future. The proximity to Seminyak was perfect and with the car and driver it made getting anywhere easy. I would highly recommend this villa to anyone wanting to be near the hustle and bustle of Seminyak but being able to return to a tranquil oasis within minutes.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>From the time of arrival to the time of departure, we were greeted with service that was second to none. Despite the last minute order in our meal, the staff still served us with manners & delicious local food. Despite us being messy & indecisive in our plannings, the Villa still treated us like royalty. Despite the fact that we were all students, there was no discrimination towards our status. 

With the design & ambiance of the Villa put together with the service of the staff, it was an incredible relaxing experience. The chef were really skilled in what they do, I've never tasted such heavenly cooking. All in all, we really felt at home with the freedom to roam around the Villa as we pleased, to blast music through your first class sound system & even allowing us to cook our own meals. THANK YOU SO MUCH for showing us the first class Balinese experience, we hope to see you in the near future.

warmest regards,
the G6 designers</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>The villa is very well maintained. Staff are very friendly & helpful. We love the spacious feel, with each individual bedroom villas separated from one & another, it gives enough privacy & yet everyone are still within same compound.
Will highly recommend to my friends.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Perfect! Everything was absolutley perfect. The grounds were beautiful, the rooms were luxurious, the staff were gorgeous, the location was perfect, far enough away to get some peace and quiet but close enough thats its just a short drive to Seminyak etc and it was still close enough to walk to local things like a massuer, a shop and resturants while saying hi to friendly locals on the way. We had 5 kiddies under 4 with us and we all felt safe around the pool with them and we had a great time just hanging out at the villa. Lots of grassed areas for the kids to play away from the pool. The staff were great in every aspect and we had the best drivers to take us anywhere we wanted!
My whole family would highly recommend this villa. We will be back next year for sure.</ROverallComments>
