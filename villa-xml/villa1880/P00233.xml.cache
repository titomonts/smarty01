      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa 1880 is extraordinary – a contemporary-meets-colonial beach-in-ten vacation home, a design aficionado’s dream, and heaven for a few families (up to 8 adults and 8 kids) intent on holidaying together effortlessly, in total comfort and with considerable style. &nbsp;</p><p>The heart of Villa 1880 is a beautifully restored plantation house from Borneo, made entirely of ironwood and constructed in 1880 – hence the name. Full of heritage charm, the house sits between two contemporary structures: a vast open-sided living room with sunset barbecue terrace above, and a two-storey sleeping pavilion lined with lime green shutters in homage to its colonial cousin.</p><p>Staying here is a dream for creatives and all who appreciate a refined design aesthetic. The visionary Hong Kong-based owners, an interior architect and vintage furniture showroom founder, have uncompromisingly high standards and an obsessive attention to detail. Italian retro furniture, vintage collector’s pieces, designer fabrics, inventive lighting and contemporary art are all part of the eclectic mix. Everything is achingly chic and high spec with no expense spared on leading-edge facilities (including mood lighting and a water filtration system which means guests may drink water direct from the taps – a rare convenience in Bali villas).</p><p>Families will appreciate the fabulous indoor and alfresco living spaces and five bedroom suites – one of them an eight-bunk children’s suite. Add a 19m saltwater pool with shaded shallow kids’ section, private spa, two kitchens, and a remarkably gifted chef among the eight-professional staff, and you have all the ingredients to whip up the most memorable holiday imaginable. </p><p>Villa 1880 is tucked away down a quiet lane a few minutes’ walk from uber-trendy Batu Belig Beach and a 10-minute drive from both Seminyak and Canggu. There’s a vintage ‘70s VW Combi available to whisk guests to Bali’s many temples and tourist attractions (extra charge applies). But such is Villa 1880’s allure, you may never want to leave.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>From heritage ironwood to Hermes upholstery, Villa 1880 delivers a mega-dose of style in micro detail. Skilfully crafted from a 19th century colonial plantation house sitting between two unapologetically modern pavilions, the villa has a flawless design pedigree shaped by the vision of the owners – an interior architect and vintage store owner who share uncompromisingly high standards and an obsessive attention to detail. </p><p>Throughout the villa, traditional materials sit comfortably with contemporary design elements in light-filled, uncluttered rooms where every piece of achingly chic furniture has a story to tell. Chat in style on the Miniform Colony armchairs in the formal living area, or perched on vintage Italian barstools in front of a Filippo Sciascia painting on terracotta. Dip into some Asian literature in the flamboyantly decorated media room under the sleepless eye of a stuffed peacock. And you’re unlikely to be stuck for conversation seated at the four-metre long dining table on Emu Re Touve chairs under a galaxy of pendant lights repurposed from old mercury pots rescued from a Chinese shipwreck!</p><p>Villa 1880 is designed with families very much in mind. It’s easy to keep an eye on little ones frolicking in the 19-metre saltwater pool’s shaded shallow area from the retro sofa or swaying hammock. And why not slip into the spa while they play table tennis close by? At day’s end, after sunset cocktails and a sumptuous seafood barbecue prepared by the uber-talented chef on the roof terrace, parents can retreat to the privacy of their air-conditioned suites, while kids enjoy a perpetual slumber party in their own eight-bunk bedroom. </p><p>With the wonderfully attentive staff on hand to anticipate your every whim, you may not want to leave the villa. But if you can tear yourself away, the broad expanse of Batu Belig Beach beckons 500 metres away. Or pile into the vintage 1970s restored VW combi and head to Seminyak or Canggu, or explore Bali’s myriad attractions further afield. </p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa 1880 comprises an antique plantation house sandwiched between two contemporary buildings: a flat-roofed living pavilion at the front and a double-storey bedroom block at the back. The entrance leads directly to the large open-sided living pavilion lying alongside the 19m pool, with open-plan guest kitchen and bar at one end, leading to the chef’s kitchen. A large terrace runs from the shallow section of the pool to the master suite and the spa, and houses a casual seating area. From here, steps lead up to the veranda which wraps around two sides of the house, providing access to the sunset roof terrace, two guest bedrooms, children’s bunk room, media room and, above, the romantic attic bedroom.&nbsp; </p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>In-villa dining is one of the many highlights of a stay at Villa 1880. Guests are fortunate to have on hand a world-class chef who brings passion and creativity to the table as well as culinary expertise honed at Sardine, one of Bali’s most celebrated restaurants. He skillfully whips up hearty or healthy breakfasts, casual lunches, alfresco barbecues or gourmet dinners served family-style according to your tastes. Choose from an inspired menu that highlights Bali’s rich harvest from both land and sea, explores the Indonesian archipelago’s culinary diversity, and delivers a new take on western favourites with delicious meals and multi-dish set menus. </p><p>Sample the chef’s home-made preserves with fresh sourdough bread at breakfast. Linger over a poolside lunch of chicken, cashew and tarragon wraps, nasi goring or risotto with crabmeat and asparagus. Nibble on captivating canapés over sunset cocktails, then enjoy a mouth-watering seafood barbecue on the rooftop terrace bathed in moonlight. The chef’s desserts are legendary; insist on a cheesecake or mango pannacotta during your stay. </p><p>Kids are well catered for, and there’s also an excellent selection of vegetarian and super-healthy options… and the chef is more than happy to tailor meals to accommodate any special dietary requirements. Conveniently, there’s also an excellent menu of wines readily available at supermarket prices with no mark up.</p><p>It is advisable to plan meals the evening before to allow adequate time for the chef to prepare. The staff will then undertake the grocery shopping, visiting the local markets and specialty food shops in Seminyak. Groceries and beverages are charged at cost price plus 20% and a handling fee, and staff will keep all receipts for reference. Guests are kindly requested to provide the manager with grocery money in advance.</p>]]></Description>
