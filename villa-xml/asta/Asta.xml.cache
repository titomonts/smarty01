      <Description><![CDATA[<p>If you were to create a wish list for your ideal villa vacation, there’s a good chance that Villa Asta will tick all your boxes – and some more. A 10-minute walk from Batubelig Beach on Bali’s south western coast, this five bedroom villa is a top choice for groups of friends and families with kids of all ages. </p><p>The huge free-form swimming pool curving through the centre of the villa grounds is the natural focus; its swim-through waterfall, circular overlapping sun-deck and 4-metre high bale-in-the-sky dive platform guarantees hours of fun – and all in view of the open-sided living and dining pavilions that spill onto the poolside terrace in a perfect example of Bali-influenced tropical living. An enormous second level rice-field-view games room provides more entertainment in the form of a pool table, table tennis, home theatre, computer and library of board games overlooking the villa’s own badminton/volleyball lawn. There’s also a TV room with movie library and a second computer for guest use.</p><p>The configuration of bedrooms gives an unusual level of flexibility. On the ground floor of the games pavilion, the three guest bedrooms are designed for flexible living; each has twins that convert to a king, with a pair of trundle beds underneath – perfect for 6 adults or up to 12 youngsters. Parents can retreat to the master pavilion the other side of the pool, where they enjoy the privacy of two master bedrooms and a plunge pool. </p><p>The dining and living pavilions provide the social heart of Villa Asta – guests converge on the enormous 12-to-18 seat dining table for gourmet meals prepared by the villa chef and served by butlers who are on call 24/7. With such cosseting, there’s little need to leave the villa. But for those who want to venture out, Batubelig Beach is a ten-minute walk away (closer if you take the villa bicycles). And a driver and car is available for an additional cost to take guests to the acclaimed restaurants and bars of Seminyak, to the Finns Recreation Club (where they enjoy complimentary membership), or further afield on a day’s sight-seeing tour of the island.</p><br /><br />                                    ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Asta is a fully staffed five-bedroom residence an easy walk from  Batubelig Beach on Bali’s south-west coast, and a five-minute drive from  Seminyak. With a spectacular free-form swimming pool, a large plunge  pool, massive games room, TV room, and membership of the Finns Recreation Club,  Villa Asta is perfect for active families or groups of friends who seek  R&amp;R with lots of entertainment options in a sociable environment  with space and plenty of privacy.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Asta weaves its magic the moment you walk through the entrance and glimpse the pool, shimmering beyond a waterfall, framed within a circular opening in the wall. Flowing water features are everywhere; in addition to the dramatic free-form swimming pool at the villa's heart, there’s a 12-metre plunge pool next to the master bedroom pavilion, linked by an expanse of koi ponds to the two open-sided living and dining pavilions.</p><p>This is a fantastic villa for families – it was designed by internationally renowned architect Guy Morgan for two friends seeking a place for their young families to holiday together, so there’s plenty to amuse kids (of all ages) as well as lots of welcome grown-up space. And parents can relax and enjoy their holiday knowing their children are having a great time within the secure villa grounds.</p><p>The main pool provides plenty of entertainment, with shallow tiers for wallowing and a deep section beneath a two-storey thatched balé with a viewing platform looking out over the rice fields. At the far end of the pool the huge upper-floor games room also promises hours of fun, with its pool table, table tennis, home theatre and computer. Just behind is a badminton / volleyball court - a complete kids’ zone!</p><p>Below the games room, three twin bedrooms can be converted to kings making them equally suitable for adults (each also has two handy roll-away beds for extra young guests). Providing a calm environment at the other end of the villa is the two-bedroomed master pavilion with its own large plunge pool.</p><p>With so much on offer, there’s little call to leave the villa – especially because among the delightfully professional staff is an excellent chef adept at whipping up meals that would give some of Bali’s famed restaurants a run for their money. But it’s good to know Batubelig Beach is only a short walk away, and a car and driver is available for an additional cost to whisk guests to nearby Seminyak, or further afield to explore the island.</p>]]></Description>

At one end of the  garden a two-storey pavilion houses three guest bedroom suites and,  above, an enormous open-sided games room with kitchenette and shower  room. A single-storey pavilion with two master bedroom suites sits at  the other end, reached via flagstones across koi ponds and a bridge  across the second swimming pool. In between is double-decker poolside  balé, an open-sided living pavilion, and a separate dining pavilion with  service kitchen, bar and adjacent TV room/study.</p>]]></Description>

Both bedrooms are tastefully decorated with bold  colours, rich fabrics, bright scatter cushions, and local artwork and  artefacts. In each, a canopied four-poster king-size bed sits under a  soaring thatched roof, while an extra-long window seat provides a  peaceful place to relax with a book or watch the 29-inch plasma TV.  Beyond sliding glass doors are private garden bathrooms, dominated by  splendid over-sized, marble bathtubs sheltered from the elements by the  eaves of the roof. Doors in the garden walls lead to the plunge pool,  neatly avoiding the need to walk through the bedrooms. </p>  ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa  Asta’s manager will have a wealth of information about nearby places of  interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings  required. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Many of them live  nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the  fascinating aspects of Bali life.</p> <p>In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.</p> <ul><li> It's possible to walk the sands of<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Seminyak's Petitenget beach </span>all the  way to Kuta in the south, or north to Canggu. The beach is more popular  with locals than tourists (not safe for swimming in most sections), but  is a great spot for building sandcastles or to watch the sunset as you  sip a cocktail from one of the many beachside bars. </li><li> Sports enthusiasts should head to Bali’s prestigious <span style="font-weight: bold;">Finns Recreation Club</span>, with  its state-of-the-art gym and tennis and squash courts. Round off your  workout with some fine international dining, then stock up on gourmet  goodies at the nearby Canggu Deli. </li><li> Be sure to visit mystical <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hotel Tugu Bali</span> at Canggu Beach. Bali’s first  museum hotel is studded with priceless Indonesian artworks and antiques  and its award-winning spa offers age-old Eastern therapies. If you’re  planning a honeymoon, this makes a wonderful first night venue. </li><li>The most exclusive<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Bali trekking tour</span> promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href="http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title="Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise.">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise.</a></li><li> Make the <em>de rigueur</em> pilgrimage to sacred <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pura Tanah Lot</span>, one of  Bali’s biggest tourist magnets. Perched high on a craggy, wave-lashed  rock, this ancient sea temple is best savoured at sunset but is less  busy in the mornings; be sure to receive a blessing from the Hindu  priests. </li><li> Fashionistas, trendies and shop-a-holics should hot-foot it down to <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Seminyak</span>, Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave. Here, you can indulge for  hours in the glut of stylish, chic boutiques. There is a wide choice of  fine dining, mid range, and cheap ‘n cheerful restaurants in Seminyak  too: fine dining venues include Sarong, the famous Ku Dé Ta, Mama San,  La Lucciola, Sardine and Métis. </li><li> Drive westwards to explore the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan regency</span>, revealing  terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand  beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the  volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan  with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu – one of  Bali’s most important temples. </li><li> Explore Bali's backroads, lakes, volcanoes, forests and beaches on the  back of a Harley Davidson bike with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Island Biker Tours</span>. Full day Harley  tours, customised tours or shorter joy rides can all be accommodated. </li><li> With its warm seas, almost year-round season, relatively uncrowded beach  and reef breaks and suitability for all levels of experience, Bali  surfing is world renowned. There are <span style="font-weight: bold;">surf schools</span> aplenty in the  Seminyak/Kuta area, so why not sign up for a course and learn how to  ride the waves? </li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The family friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want. Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is a real plus – and one that means parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday too.</p><p>Villa Asta was purposefully designed as vacation home for families… and it shows. Kids get their own games room with table tennis, pool table, TV and computer, board games and toys, as well as a badminton and volleyball court.

The three twin-bedded guest rooms are ideal for anything up to 12 children (with two roll-away beds in each room).</p><p>The team of friendly staff at Villa Asta will make children feel as welcome as adults, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost).</p><p>Although the equipped kitchen allows you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will happily to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest. Banana and pineapple pancakes for breakfast? Popeye fried chicken in the games room for lunch? No problem. The chef can customise all meals to suit children’s taste buds.</p><p>Don’t worry about packing all that cumbersome kids’ equipment for your stay. Just let us know what you need, and anything we don’t have in-house (the villa is equipped with two high chairs, two cots and a playpen) we can hire on your behalf (<a title="Children's equipment - Elite Havens" target="_blank" href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf">click here</a> to see list of available hire items).</p><p>And when the excitement of exploring the villa starts to wear off, check out our <a title="Villa Asta - things to do" target="_blank" href="http://www.villaasta.com/things-to-do.html">Things to do</a> page – there’s plenty in the area to keep all the family amused throughout the holiday.</p>]]></Description>
