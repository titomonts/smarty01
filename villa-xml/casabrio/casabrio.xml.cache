      <Description><![CDATA[Villa Casa Brio’s manager has a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Chat to the staff too; many have been attached to the villa from the beginning, and are a great source of insider information. In the meantime, here’s a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa. <br /><br /><ul><li>You could <span style="font-weight: bold;">eat out</span> at a different restaurant in Seminyak every night - for months - and still not run out of options. Jalan Laksmana (also known as Jalan Oberoi and Jalan Kayu Aya) is Bali’s fashionable ‘Eat Street’, offering plenty of high-end restaurants. La Lucciola Restaurant is great for sunset drinks, as is The Breeze at The Samaya. While Ku Dé Ta is still the place to see and be seen, two new beachclubs, Cocoon and Potato Head, are classy seaside alternatives. Then there's La Plancha, a rustic beach bar between Double Six and Gado Gado, very popular, good tapas, very reasonably priced drinks, with live music and DJ events.&nbsp; A short taxi to Kerobokan will bring you to Sardine and Métis (from the owners of former and fabulous Kafé Warisan) and Naughty Nuri's Batubelig&nbsp; (a franchise of the original in Ubud) famous for BBQ ribs and wicked Martinis. Mid-range dining options here include Wah Wah Gourmet Burger Winebar which specialises in sassy burgers with sexy connotations, and numerous other cheap 'n cheerful options.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shop til you drop!</span> In Seminyak and neighbouring Kerobokan you can rummage for treasures through cluttered little stores and dark junkshops crammed to the ceiling with curios and 'made-to-order' antiques, derive inspiration from classy homeware shops, or wander through huge furniture warehouses. For furniture and homewares check out Lio Collection, Christy, and Sun. Soft furnishings abound at Haveli, Sunbebek and Disini, and Geneva is the one-stop shop for handicrafts. Gone are the days when ladies fashion in Bali was limited to batik rayon sundresses. The last few years has seen a flood of new designer boutiques in the Seminyak area. In Jalan Laksmana (Eat Street) you can shop between courses!&nbsp; Boutiques include Paul Ropp, Biasa, Magali Pascal, Anouck, Lily Jean, Bamboo Blond, Dinda Rella, Innuendo, Religion, Body &amp; Soul, Buddha Wear, M. Harcourt, Pura Vida, and Uma &amp; Leopold to name but a few. Kids fashion stores include Kidsagogo and Kiki's Closet.&nbsp; For art lovers, galleries worth visiting in Seminyak include Randelli Gallery, Biasa and Kendra.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pura Petitenget </span>at the beachside off Jalan Petitenget is a compact, pretty Balinese temple, which is known for particularly spectacular beach-side ceremonies. There has been a temple here since at least the 16th century, and although this is not one of the key nine directional temples of Bali, it is an important link in the series of west coast temples between Pura Uluwatu and Pura Tanah Lot.</li><li>In-villa <span style="font-weight: bold;">beauty and massage treatments</span> carried out by professional therapists can normally be arranged with ease, but if you'd prefer to visit one of Seminyak's spas, we recommend: Bodyworks (quality treatments at very reasonable prices - a favourite with Bali’s expats); Callego (a casual massage centre with a small restaurant attached); Chill (super reflexology treatments - great for jetlag); Prana Spa for Ayurvedic treatments.</li><li>There are several <span style="font-weight: bold;">surf schools</span> in Bali, mainly based in and around Kuta and Legian, where young and old(er) can learn to surf or brush up on their skills.</li><li>Explore Bali's backroads, lakes, volcanoes, forests and beaches on the back of a Harley Davidson bike with Island Biker Tours. Full day <span style="font-weight: bold;">Harley tours</span>, customised tours or shorter joy rides can all be accommodated.</li><li>Take a drive over to Bali’s Bukit peninsula: the 18-hole <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali National Golf Club in Nusa Dua</span>, one of the best courses on the island, is perched on a cliff 70m above the roaring Indian ocean. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Uluwatu Temple</span> (Pura Uluwatu) is one of Bali's nine key directional temples.&nbsp; Facing west and with steep headlands on either side creating an unbelievably dramatic setting, sunsets over Uluwatu are a sight not to be missed.</li><li>On the way back, stop off for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">seafood feast at Jimbaran</span> – a must for every holiday in Bali. Dozens of seafood warungs (cafés) line this west-facing beach, perfect for a sunset dinner.&nbsp; Fine dining options are available at most of the big resort hotels in this area; notably PJ’s, the charming beachside restaurant at the Four Seasons in Jimbaran, serving Mediterranean-styled cuisine.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[Casa Brio’s magnificent, open-sided, fan-cooled living pavilion is the villa’s social heart. Below a vaulted roof, an expanse of acid-washed marble floor flows towards the ironwood deck fronting the pool. To one side, sofas, armchairs and ottomans – all plushly upholstered in textured grey – face a coffee table set on a seagrass rug. Arranged at an angle under copper pendant lights, a huge Suarwood table seats 10 in comfortable upholstered dining chairs. Behind is a smoked glass table with five bar seats, adjoining the granite bar counter of the butler’s pantry. Out of sight is the villa’s well-equipped kitchen.<br /><br />Guests seeking air-conditioned comfort will find plenty of space in the media room to curl up on a beanbag with a novel, or languish on one of the sofas set before the 42-inch TV. With a shower room attached, this room can also be used as a fifth bedroom. The sofas double as extra beds and can be set up as two singles or a king.<br /><br />Casa Brio offers equally generous outdoor relaxation space. The roof terrace above the media room provides an additional living area – a partially covered sun trap with comfortable all-weather rattan seating, a butler’s counter and sweeping pool-and-sky views. At one end of the pool, a bale provides a shaded setting for alfresco breakfasts. At the opposite end, between the two garden-level bedrooms, is a large cushioned alcove. And on the ironwood deck running the full length of the greenstone pool, sun loungers and gigantic beanbags await.]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[Brio is the Italian word for liveliness, vivacity, verve – the perfect name for this bright and breezy Seminyak villa that sparkles on every count. First impressions are of generosity, both in space and design. Think luxurious living spaces and glamorous bedroom suites, contemporary furnishings and designer homewares in a palette of cool grey and dusky pink. In the enormous vaulted living pavilion, uncompromisingly comfortable super-sized sofas sit on acres of marble flooring, and a solid Suarwood dining table stretches almost four metres under uber-chic pendant lighting – all facing a 21-metre swimming pool edged with an ironwood sun deck.<br /><br />From 7am ‘til 11pm staff are discreetly on hand, ready to attend to your every whim, serving drinks and snacks and providing delicious meals from an enticing suggestion menu. When there’s no need to lift a finger, how will you spend your day in paradise? Perhaps start with a breakfast of perfectly poached eggs served in the poolside bale. Then cool off in the pool and recline on a sun lounger with a good book. Follow a light lunch with a siesta or in-villa massage, then an hour or so of browsing the many fashion and lifestyle boutiques just a short walk away. As the day draws to a close, sip a sunset cocktail on the rooftop terrace or stroll down to one of Bali’s iconic beach bars. Then return to a gourmet candle-lit dinner prepared by the accomplished villa chef. <br /><br />Casa Brio offers Bali-style indoor-outdoor living at its best, with all the ingredients for a blissful Bali holiday: stand-out accommodation, a seven-strong staff, and a stellar (yet secluded) beach-in-five Seminyak location – perfect for multi-generation families (including less mobile or wheelchair-bound guests) as well as groups of friends. <br />]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[Guests of Casa Brio enjoy the expertise of their own very accomplished chef who brings a culinary expertise plus a spirit of adventure to his dishes. <br /><br />The villa’s suggestion menu of Indonesian, Asian and Western dishes is extensive, covering everything from poolside snacks, salads and light lunches to gourmet dinners and seafood barbecues – and all served home-style. Should a guest crave something off-menu, the chef will happily oblige, creating dishes according to personal taste, as well as tailoring meals to accommodate any special dietary requirements. <br /><br />To give the kitchen team time to shop for the freshest ingredients, it’s a good idea to plan meals a day in advance. Staff will do the shopping and keep the receipts for reference – groceries and beverages are charged at cost price plus 20%++ handling fee.]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[Villa holidays are a great choice for families, who can enjoy their own private facilities plus the freedom to use them whenever you want. Knowing that the kids can enjoy themselves independently and safely, without having to worry about them disturbing other guests, means that parents will have a more relaxed holiday too. In that respect, Casa Brio is a great villa for families. Those with young children will appreciate the shallow section of the 21-metre swimming pool; a safety net can be stretched across to prevent toddlers from moving to deeper waters. And parents may keep an eye on them from the comfort of the living pavilion that opens onto the full length of the pool deck. Older kids are likely to claim the over-sized pool beanbags or make a beeline for the media room where there is a small selection of DVDs.<br /><br />The friendly staff at Casa Brio will make children feel as welcome as adults, which gives parents plenty of flexibility and the freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost).<br /><br />Although the well-equipped kitchen allows you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will happily to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa chef. Chocolate ice cream on the pool deck? Toasted cheese sandwiches in the media room? No problem! The cook can customise all meals to suit children’s taste buds.<br /><br />And don’t worry about packing all that cumbersome kids’ equipment for your stay. Just let us know what you need; anything we don’t have in-house (villa facilities include a baby cot, high chair and baby bath) we can arrange for you upon request. (See full list of available hire items). And when the excitement of exploring the villa starts to wear off, check out our <a href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html" target="_self" title="things to do - Casa Brio">Things to do</a> page; there’s plenty in the area to keep all the family amused throughout the holiday.<br />]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[Contemporary architecture, artful interiors, abundant living space, glamorous bedroom suites and a stunning 21-metre pool define Casa Brio, a fully staffed four-bedroom villa that promises discerning families and groups of friends a sparkling vacation in the heart of Seminyak on Bali’s southwestern shore.<br /><br />The villa certainly lives up to its name; Brio is Italian for vivacity, and it’s easy to imagine lively social gatherings in the open-sided living pavilion, animated conversation around the huge dining table, and high-spirited cocktails on the sunset roof terrace. There’s Italian brio in the contemporary design too – think clean architectural lines, light-filled living spaces, and a laid-back colour palette of cool grey with a splash of dusky pink. All this provides a canvas for those uniquely Balinese elements: open-air tropical living, a garden ablaze with orchids, frangipanis and palms, and winsome Balinese staff with warm smiles and a can-do attitude. Cappuccino from the DeLonghi coffee maker? An ice-cold Bintang on the pool deck? A massage in the cushioned poolside bale? Teatime snacks in the air-conditioned media room? A candlelit dinner created by the resident chef? A flower petal bath in the bathroom garden courtyard? Nothing is too much trouble for the highly professional seven-strong team.<br /><br />The icing on the cake is Casa Brio’s stellar Seminyak location – secluded and peaceful yet within moments of Petitenget Beach and the island’s most popular restaurants and bars. But with an accomplished private chef on hand to whip up gourmet meals, who would want to leave the villa?]]></Description>
