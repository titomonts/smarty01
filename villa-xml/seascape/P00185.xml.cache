      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Seascape is a stunning home on the ocean’s edge that is set to raise the bar for contemporary tropical living.<br /><br />Seascape is the perfect name for this spectacular villa, which offers expansive ocean vistas from its prime beachfront position. Bali-based Italian architect Valentina Audrito shaped the ultra-modern design with her signature playful use of space, soaring ceilings and creative blend of natural and fabricated material. The result is a laid-back-beach-house-meets-luxury-loft-living vibe that encourages guests to kick off their Jimmy Choos in favour of uber-cool (but uncompromisingly comfortable) barefoot bliss.<br /><br />The maxi-minimalist design aesthetic is perfectly pitched, with a beach-chic colour palette of neutrals and aquas, and a circular theme softening the rectangular shapes, from decorative alcoves to bathroom mirrors to the pool terrace. All the rooms are adorned with natural materials — polished pebble and teakwood floors, terrazzo walls and bathtubs, bamboo screens, seagrass rugs, custom-designed furniture using plaited rope and rattan, and shells decorating woven baskets, curtain tie-backs and wooden bowls. Among the contemporary luxuries are sublimely comfortable King Koil beds, crisp cotton bed-linen, 52-inch TVs, NID music system, Bose speakers and home cinema. And attention to the smallest detail is evident in thoughtful extras such as beach bags in the bedrooms and Sensatia toiletries in the bathroom.<br /><br />The entire family will love the many imaginative spaces here, whether hanging out in the huge netted chill-out zone suspended above the living area, lounging in the shallows of the 15-metre pool, gathering around the beach-edge fire-pit for sunset cocktails, or sprawling in front of the cinema screen for a post-dinner movie. While remaining discreetly out of sight until required, the staff is on hand to help guests make the most of their stay; among them is an accomplished chef who can whip up everything from simple lunches to beachfront barbecues and gourmet dinners.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Seascape’s double-height living room, media room and three guest bedrooms occupy a contemporary two-storey ocean-facing building. The fourth guest bedroom is housed on the upper floor of the Garden Cottage, a separate building to the rear of the main house. The service kitchen is situated on the ground floor of the Garden Cottage. From the entrance, steps across a courtyard pond lead directly into the living space with open-plan guest kitchen to the left, ground-level bedroom suite and guest cloakroom to the right and, down a few steps, the main living room. This opens onto a dining terrace, beyond which is the swimming pool, sun terrace, pool bar and beach edge seating around a fire-pit. Off the living area is the media room, which can be set up as a fifth bedroom with attached bathroom. Two further guest bedrooms flank the upper level, linked by an aerial bridge that also gives access to the netting-floored mezzanine above the entrance and kitchen area.</p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>On the upper floor of the Garden Cottage, a super-king bed rests under a romantic white-crepe-tented ceiling before a wall of mirror that enhances the sense of space. Opposite, a comfortably upholstered sofa faces a 52-inch wall-mounted TV with satellite channels and DVD player; draw the gauze curtains to conceal it if you prefer. Lofty double doors of plaited bamboo slide back to reveal the open-sided, bamboo-screened bathroom with celadon porcelain basins and, behind curtains of hanging beads, the large shower enclosure. </p> ]]></Description>

The view is even better from the private sun-trap balcony with neon-pink chairs. A pair of stylish bamboo chairs provides a space to sit and change in comfort within the bathroom, where blue and white basins sit on a terrazzo vanity facing trees through a bamboo screen, and beaded curtains camouflage the walk-in rain-shower. </p> ]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>Cooled by ceiling fans and the sea breeze, Villa Seascape’s soaring double-height living room is the villa’s social heart. This impressive split-level space is designed with easy entertaining in mind. Glass doors fold back fully onto a double-height terrace where a dining table comfortably seating ten commands pool and ocean views. Within, clusters of contemporary modular sofas and woven rattan ottomans invite both sparkling conversation and quiet repose. The beautifully designed kitchen, with distinctive wedge-shaped island counter is slightly elevated and lightly screened behind columns of distinctive ceramic lamps. While it gives guests the convenience of a fridge, hob and coffee machine, the chef prepares meals in the staff kitchen behind the main villa building. </p>]]></Description>

To one side are pool-and-ocean views through sliding doors that open onto the terrace. Opposite, mirrored doors open onto a huge semi-open bathroom with walls of mirror and coloured terrazzo, statement blue terrazzo tub with rain shower above, and an alfresco shower in the courtyard.

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>This stunningly designed poolside space spills out beyond the dining terrace towards the spectacular 15-metre swimming pool. On one side, over-sized beanbags rest on the pebble-stone deck in front of a cushioned bench built into a gracefully curved coral wall. Across the pool is the pool bar where an elongated island of polished concrete and aqua-coloured timber stretches out under a sail awning, providing an outdoor kitchen and a sit-up bar counter for alfresco meals.<br /><br />Inches away from the beach, semi-circular polished concrete seating curves around a fire-pit — the perfect place for sunset cocktails and after-dinner star-gazing.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>A particular highlight of a Seascape holiday is in-villa dining. Guests at Villa Seascape enjoy the expertise of their own very accomplished chef who is on hand to prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner daily.<br /><br />The villa provides complimentary daily breakfast as well as extensive restaurant-style priced menu of Indonesian, Asian and international dishes from poolside snacks, salads and light lunches to seafood barbecues and gourmet dinners – all served home-style either on the dining terrace or at the pool bar counter. The chef is happy to tailor meals to meet personal taste, special requests and dietary preferences, and the menu includes vegetarian options and children’s favourites. A stay is surely not complete without sampling some of Bali’s celebrated culinary specialities such as Babi Guling (roast spiced suckling pig) and Ayam Betutu (fragrant Balinese steamed chicken).<br /><br />We encourage you to plan meals a day in advance with the villa manager and chef, to allow time to shop for the freshest ingredients — many of which need to be ordered in from mainland Bali.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Seascape occupies a commanding position on a small crescent beach on the south-western shore of Nusa Lembongan overlooking the Devil’s Tear, a local landmark where breakers crash along the limestone headland. The cove is home to a handful of prestigious villas, as well as the Sandy Bay Beach Club, which has a popular beachside restaurant and spa. While kids will enjoy playing on the sand, it’s not advisable to swim in the cove due to strong surf and currents. But Dream Beach, a lovely swimming beach, is just a 10-minute stroll away across the headland, while a 15-minute walk northwards brings you to the gentle waters and noted restaurants and bars of Mushroom Bay.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Seascape’s staff has a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will happily share insights on island living. In the meantime, here’s a taste of the many and varied activities on Nusa Lembongan and its bigger, wilder neighbour, Nusa Penida.</p><ul><li>Clamber across the rocks to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Devil’s Tear</span>, a craggy limestone outcrop on the southern tip of Sandy Bay; on a clear day, you can see Bali’s sacred mountain.</li><li>Head for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dream Beach</span>, a 10-minute walk southwards along the cliff path, for a swim in a cove of shallow sloping sand, followed by lunch at Café Pandan, set on the cliff top above the beach.</li><li>Let our manager book a jukung, a colourfully painted traditional fishing outrigger, so you can <span style="font-weight: bold;">cruise the coastline</span>, visit quiet beaches and enjoy a spot of <span style="font-weight: bold;">snorkelling</span>.</li><li>Visit the deserted beaches and blue lagoons of Nusa Lembongan’s tiny neighbour, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nusa Ceningan</span>, linked by the Yellow Bridge.</li><li>Adrenaline junkies, visit <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mahana Point</span> on Nusa Ceningan, and hurl yourself off the cliff top into the sea! Or order a cold Bintang beer from the café and watch the surfers cresting huge rollers below.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take a leisurely tour of the island</span> visiting temples, mangroves, beaches and the villages of Lembongan and Jungutbatu. Ask our manager to organise bicycles, scooters or a beach buggy for you.</li><li>Stroll into Mushroom Bay one evening for <span style="font-weight: bold;">a romantic beachfront dinner </span>at Café Bali. Or pop over to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Beach Club at Sandy Bay</span> for an evening cocktail and barbecue of fresh fish and meats.</li><li>Visit the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Underground House</span> in Lembongan Village, a labyrinth of caves excavated from the limestone rock by local farmer and priest Made Biasa using only a hammer, chisel – and 15 years patience and hard work.</li><li>Climb the steps to Pura Puncak Sari, a <span style="font-weight: bold;">sacred hilltop temple</span> which commands fabulous views over the neighboring islands and Bali’s east coast.</li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nusa Penida</span></p><ul><li>Don’t miss the spectacular natural rock arch over the turquoise waters of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Broken Beach</span> (Pasih Uug). Hike or bike to get to this amazing cove on Nusa Penida’s north west tip – and don’t forget your camera. Although you can’t actually swim here as there’s no access to the water, you’ll be able to cool off at nearby Angel’s Billabong. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Angel’s</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Billabong </span>(Kolam Para Bidadari) is a natural infinity pool of crystal clear river water flowing into the sea, framed by craggy rocks and cliffs overlooking the ocean. Take a dip with the angels and enjoy the stunning scenery.</li><li>Watch out as waves hit the rocks and send great plumes of water into the sky at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Smoky Beach</span> (Pasih Andus) – just the place for a refreshing shower!</li><li>Take your mask and snorkel to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Crystal Bay</span> (Surganya Pecinta) where the water is clear, the waves are calm and beautiful clusters of coral – home to colourful tropical fish – are waiting to be discovered. </li><li>It’s a long steep climb down to the white sands and crystal-clear waters of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kelingking Beach</span>, but even if you just visit to take photos of the unique T-Rex-shaped cliff formation from the top, your trip will be worth it. </li><li>Nusa Penida is a wonderful destination for divers. Let our manager <span style="font-weight: bold;">book a few dives</span> with Villa Voyage’s recommended dive center for your chance to get up close and personal with magnificent <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manta rays</span> at the eponymously named Manta Point or, from late July to November, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mola-Mola</span>, huge oceanic sunfish. For the less experienced diver, there are easier flat reef and wall dives in the crystal clear waters around Nusa Lembongan.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Yearning for a sand-between-the-toes tropical island experience? Fantasising about an away-from-it-all beachfront home? Consider your dreams fulfilled at the sublime Villa Seascape on Nusa Lembongan, a small island off the southeast coast of Bali.</p><p>The dictionary defines the word seascape as a view of an expanse of sea. It’s the perfect name for this fabulous five-bedroom villa that enjoys a rare, absolute beachfront setting on the edge of small cove. Across the bay ocean rollers send dramatic spumes of spray high above the headland, Devil’s Tear; at night the lights of Sanur glimmer on Bali’s mainland 12 kilometres away across the Badung Straits.</p><p>Designed by Bali-based Italian architect Valentina Audrito, noted for her playful use of space, Villa Seascape offers an extraordinary variety of living areas, orbiting a double-height living room that spills onto a poolside entertainment terrace with access onto the beach. The interiors are thoroughly contemporary, with chic minimalist furniture in cool aqua colours resting on polished pebble floors, warmed by the creative use of bamboo, teakwood, terrazzo and shell. With the exception of the master bedroom pavilion, privately tucked away in the garden behind, every room in the villa enjoys spectacular ocean views.</p><p>This elegant villa promises magical experiences for families and groups of friends seeking luxury living and a laid-back vibe in a blissful beachfront setting. Daytime, recline in the shallows of the pool or on an oversized beanbag on the terrace, then convene at the pool bar for a light lunch served by the ever-attentive butler. Take an afternoon siesta on the suspended, netted-floor mezzanine, or draw the blackout curtains in the media room and languish on the gigantic floor cushion in front of a good film. Enjoy a dazzling sunset around the fire-pit or a cocktail at Sandy Bay Beach Club a minute’s walk along the beach, before tucking into a beachfront barbecue or gourmet meal prepared by the talented villa chef. After such a day, the supreme comfort of your suite and a blissful night’s sleep awaits.</p><p>Guests arriving in Bali late afternoon or evening should arrange overnight accommodation in Sanur and ferry transfers to Nusa Lembongan the following morning as sea crossings after 5pm are not recommended. A complimentary buggy will meet guests at Mushroom Bay on Nusa Lembongan for transfers to the villa.</p>]]></Description>
