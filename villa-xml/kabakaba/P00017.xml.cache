      <Description><![CDATA[Those seeking royal treatment in palatial surroundings will find all this and more at the enchanting eight-bedroom Kaba Kaba Estate. Built on royal land on the edge of Kaba Kaba village in Bali’s Tabanan regency, this stately villa will have guests in its thrall. From the Rajasthan palace elephants guarding the lotus courtyard to the gilded&nbsp;throne from a Burmese&nbsp;temple&nbsp;presiding over the dining pavilion, the stunning interiors are a treasure trove of skillfully curated antiques, curios and paintings that reveal the owners’ passion for Asian culture and <a href="/art.html">contemporary art</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br />The elegant living areas and bedroom suites scattered among the multiple pavilions of this glorious estate enjoy majestic views; beyond manicured lawns dappled with palms, lotus ponds and sparkling swimming pools, an emerald sea of rice terraces rolls towards the Indian Ocean a few kilometres south, and northwards towards Bali's dramatic volcanic peaks shimmering on the horizon. Closer to home, Kaba Kaba’s no-expenses-spared facilities command sovereign attention. Hold court at the head of the six-metre-long table set for a feast created by the accomplished chef. Sink into the deeply cushioned banquettes in the velvet-curtained home cinema. Work out in the gym before deservedly basking in a <span style="font-style: italic;">mandi lulur </span>royal body treatment at the private spa. Serve an ace on the pro tennis court, score a goal at table football and take a bike ride through the rice fields. Naturally, these fabulous facilities are accompanied by impeccable service provided by the charming, professionally trained 23-strong staff.<br />&nbsp;<br />Designed for regal entertaining, Kaba Kaba Estate is a sought-after venue for large family gatherings and special celebrations, and will capture the heart of many a bride and groom seeking a picture-perfect setting for their nuptials. What could be more idyllic than exchanging vows on the lawn, dining by candlelight under the stars, then retiring to the supremely romantic master bedroom suite with private plunge pool for a first night as newly weds?]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[Kaba Kaba Estate has an abundance of living areas spread throughout its grounds – some large enough to easily accommodate a full house of 18, some set back in private corners for those seeking a quiet retreat from the crowd.<br /><br />A formal living room rests at the heart of the estate’s main building. Conversation flows in this elegant space with generous seating, gilded Burmese and Thai Buddhas displayed against a silk-lined wall, and spectacular 180-degree views beyond the pool and garden. Sliding glass doors on two sides can be closed for air-conditioned cool, or left open for fan-assisted tropical living.<br /><br />Two more living rooms complement the guest pavilions.&nbsp;Designer fiberglass bulldogs guard the entrance to the Pilisan living area with its&nbsp;Andrew Martin&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">ikat</span>-covered seating, colourful <span style="font-style: italic;">kilim</span> and garden deck. The open-sided Pande living area exudes Raffles-style elegance with its diamond-patterned marble floor, colonial-style cane seating, steamer trunks, whirring paddle fans and crisp white colour scheme splashed with blue accents from Chinese ceramics. The TV is discreetly hidden behind sliding doors, and pride of place is given to the stately table with an 18th-century&nbsp;marble top&nbsp;from a Rajasthan palace. ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[The family friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want. Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is a real plus – and one that means parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday too.<br />&nbsp;<br />Kaba Kaba is a fabulous villa for families. Children will delight in their four-bunk bedroom and games room complete with air hockey, table football and library of books, games and toys. The media room with enormous projector, Wii&nbsp;entertainment system&nbsp;and 60-inch TV is likely to attract attention too – though with a wading pool, croquet lawn, fishing pond, tennis court and bicycles, not to mention staff-supervised activities such as Balinese dance classes or Yoga lessons – it will be easy to keep them occupied outdoors.<br />&nbsp;<br />The team of friendly staff at Kaba Kaba Estate will make children feel as welcome as adults. Having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost).<br />&nbsp;<br />Although the equipped kitchen allows you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will happily do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest. The kids' menu includes lots of all-time favourites.<br /><br />And don’t worry about packing all that cumbersome kids’ equipment for your stay. Just let us know what you need, and anything we don’t have in situ (amongst the kids' equipment already at the villa are: two cots, two high chairs; pool safety toys including AquaAlert wrist bands), we can hire on your behalf (click <a title="Children's equipment - Elite Havens" target="_blank" href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf">here</a> to see list of available hire items).<br />&nbsp;<br />When the excitement of exploring the villa starts to wear off, check out our <a title="Kaba Kaba Estate - Things to do" href="./things-to-do.html" target="_self">Things to do</a> page – there’s plenty in the area to keep all the family amused throughout the holiday.]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Kaba Kaba Estate lies on the edge of a historic rural village of the same name in the Tabanan regency of south-west Bali. With an outlook that re-affirms the regency’s epithet of ‘Bali’s rice bowl’, the villa gazes northwards and eastwards across a seemingly endless expanse of rice fields towards the majestic volcanic peaks of Mount Agung, Batur and Batukaru. This glorious setting promises guests a rare experience of Bali’s rural rhythms largely unchanged over centuries. <br /><br />Among the treasures of Kaba Kaba village are myriad temples including an ancient shrine from the 14th century, pre-dating the arrival of the Majapahit court. Bali’s iconic Tanah Lot sea temple is a ten-minute drive away, as is the wild black-sand beach at Seseh. The surfers’ haunt of Echo Beach, with its smattering of casual waterfront cafés, is only five minutes further, and the glamorous boutiques and restaurants of Seminyak are less than half an hour from the villa.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[Kaba Kaba Estate’s manager will have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange extra transport or make any bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Many of them live nearby and can give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.<br /><br />In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.<br /><br /><ol><li>With its warm seas, almost year round season, relatively uncrowded beach and reef breaks and suitability for all levels of experience, Bali <span style="font-weight: bold;">surfing </span>is world-renowned. <br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and rural villages by bicycle</span>; a great way to get under the skin of the 'real' Bali. Stop off at a local warung (café) to sample some basic Balinese fare or cool off with a cold drink.</li><li>If you’ve always dreamed of galloping along a beach or riding through villages bordered by rice fields, now’s your chance. Kuda P Stables (in Pererenan) can arrange <span style="font-weight: bold;">horse riding </span>tours, as well as children’s riding lessons and horse-drawn carriage outings.</li><li>Visit the mystical <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hotel Tugu </span>(Bali’s first museum-hotel) studded with priceless Indonesian artworks and antiques and its award-winning spa offers age-old Eastern therapies. The hotel's restaurants offer authentic Chinese and Indonesian fine dining, as well as an international menu, in a variety of unique settings. At the rustic Waroeng Tugu you can taste the traditional Javanese and Balinese cuisine of bygone centuries.</li><li>Make a pilgrimage to sacred <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pura Tanah Lot</span>, one of Bali’s biggest tourist magnets. Perched high on a craggy, wave-lashed rock, this ancient sea temple is best savoured at sunset; be sure to receive a blessing from the Hindu Priests (and watch out for the monkeys, who are very adept at helping themselves to anything from snacks to sunglasses and even cameras!)</li><li>Desa Seni at Berawa Beach, is an eco-friendly village resort providing an authentic Indonesian experience through the exploration of culture, art and yoga. The resort offers a wide variety of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yoga classes </span>and also has its own spa.</li><li>Fashionistas, trendies and shop-a-holics should hot-foot it down to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Seminyak</span>, Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave. Here, you can indulge for hours in the glut of stylish, chic boutiques. There is a wide choice of fine dining, mid range, and cheap ‘n cheerful restaurants in Seminyak too: fine dining venues include Sarong, the famous Ku Dé Ta, Mamasan, La Lucciola, Sardine and Métis.</li><li>There's a strip of <span style="font-weight: bold;">restaurants and cafés at Echo Beach </span>offering a wide range of dining options from chic and sceneful to cheap and cheerful. Try The Beach House for fresh seafood barbecues every night and live music on Sundays. And check out Café Dian here too - owned by the delightful Wayan, it serves local dishes and great fish ‘n chips.<br /></li><li>Discover the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan regency</span>, revealing terraced rice fields, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the <span style="font-weight: bold;">volcanic lakes </span>near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu – one of Bali’s most important temples. &nbsp; </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jatuluwih Rice Terraces </span>is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its preservation of traditional Balinese farming techniques. True to its name, which means extraordinary or truly marvellous, this scenic point at 850 metres (2,700ft) above sea level offers one of the most breathtaking panoramic views imaginable, with rice terraces stretching all the way to southern Bali. Padi Bali (indigenous Balinese rice) with long graceful stalks is grown here.<br /></li></ol>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>For  romantic wedding parties, extended family gatherings and groups of well-heeled  friends, the Kaba Kaba Estate is peerless. This extraordinary  no-expenses-spared eight-bedroom villa rises on royal land on the edge of the  prosperous village of Kaba Kaba in Bali’s fertile Tabanan regency, just 10  minutes from the beaches of Canggu. The setting is spectacular – &nbsp;three acres of garden extending into a sea of rice  terraces that stretch to the volcano-dotted horizon. The interiors are equally  impressive, hosting museum-quality antiques, paintings and <em>objets d’art</em> that reveal the owners’ passion for Asian culture and  contemporary art.</p><p>The estate  has been designed for lavish entertaining, supported by five-star service  provided by a large staff of butlers, housekeepers and kitchen staff including  an accomplished chef. There are multiple formal and casual living areas that  can hold a crowd – among them an air-conditioned living room, open-sided dining  pavilion with its six-metre table, large poolside sun-deck, and a huge rooftop  terrace with bar and <em>balé</em>. Spread across the  series of individual one- and two-level pavilions that make up the estate are  smaller living areas as well as decks and balconies for private ‘me’ space away  from the social whirl.</p><p>Among  the exceptional facilities are a Moroccan-themed media room with 106-inch projector  screen and 60-inch TV, a library, games room with air hockey and table  football, a well-equipped gym and professional spa. Within the extensive gardens is a 25-metre  swimming pool as well as two plunge pools (one serving the master suite and the  other adjoining a guest suite), a children’s wading pool, a superb tennis  court, croquet lawn, lotus ponds and a duck pond … complete with resident  ducks. </p><p>With its multiple-pavilion layout and magnificent facilities, Kaba Kaba  estate is perfect for two or three families who love holidaying together while  enjoying their own breathing space. And as a wedding venue, it’s breathtaking.</p>]]></Description>
