          <Description><![CDATA[<p>
 Each of the two identical and enormous mezzanine ocean suites expresses the villa&rsquo;s luxury tented safari theme to perfection; a queen-size bed is cocooned under a floating canvas tent suspended from the apex of the alang-alang roof, and the rooms are furnished with wardrobe &lsquo;tents&rsquo; in the dressing area, a folding writing desk, day bed, and steamer trunks. Coconut-wood walls and floors continue the rustic&ndash;luxe look, and large Pucci print cushions add a dash of blue to the otherwise neutral palette of browns and creams. A soaring triangular wall of glass to the front opens onto a large private ironwood balcony furnished with a round table and chairs and a pair of sun loungers and stunning sea views. To the rear of the bedroom, cunningly concealed behind screens of canvas, is a large open-plan bathroom with double basins and mirrors and glazed terrazzo enclosure with rain shower.</p>]]></Description>

 Below, the master suite continues the &lsquo;luxury under canvas&rsquo; theme, with a four-poster queen bed bedecked with canvas and leather trim, a steamer trunk acting as a media cabinet for the flat-screen 40-inch TV, a canvas seating area that conceals a spare bed, and canvas-backed directors chairs set before sliding doors delightfully opening onto the pool deck. Beyond the bedroom is a dressing area lined with leather-trimmed rattan clothes storage and shelving designed to accommodate the most profligate packer. This leads into the bathroom with double basins, patio with open-air shower and, taking pride of place before sliding doors to the beachside deck, a sculptured terrazzo bathtub.</p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>
 The garden pavilion suite stands alone, surrounded by white sand in the villa grounds. Its&rsquo; harem-style silken ceiling calls to mind Bedouin tents and desert hospitality, and such romance continues in the soft furnishings and decorations. Walls of glass offer glimpses of the sea and lead onto a private deck. The ensuite bathroom is discreetly tucked around the corner of the walled garden deck.</p>

 We recommend that guests meet with the chef at the start of their stay to chat about menus and preferred food. The chef is happy to put together menus, try out dishes, or even to cook alongside guests who are so inclined. It is also necessary to agree meals in advance (ideally 48 hours) to allow adequate time for provisioning, because nearly all the ingredients are specially ordered from the mainland and brought in by boat every morning. This also applies if the choice is to self-cater.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Welcome to Villa Voyage – a spectacular five-bedroom villa according absolute beachfront luxury in laid-back Nusa Lembongan, off Bali’s eastern coast.<br /> <br /> Voyage implies a journey, an adventure, an odyssey. It suggests the era of grand sojourns, of cruise ships and safaris, and is the perfect name for a villa whose owner loves to travel the globe: Farah Khan, whose fashion creations are favoured by many Hollywood celebrities, has styled Voyage as a barefoot luxury abode, while maintaining the old world charm of coconut-wood floors, bamboo, thatched alang-alang roof and driftwood lamps in a tropical island setting metres from the white-sand beach.<br /> <br /> There’s a sense of space and freedom in the contemporary interiors, with comfortable sofas and tables crafted from reclaimed limed teakwood set before walls of glass framing the sea view beyond the deck. Accenting the neutral colour palette of creams and greys are couture designer touches and decorative flourishes supporting the glamour travel theme.<br /> <br /> Beyond the villa walls, Voyage keeps true to its luxury adventure theme. On an island that has few cars, the villa has its own safari-style open-sided buggy for land transfers, and also available to villa guests for island expeditions is the Voyage jukung, a traditional outrigger fishing boat that has been complete with Emilio Pucci print cushions and gourmet picnic baskets. Of course, as in the days of grand travel where one was accompanied by a retinue of helpers, guests can expect to be cosseted by the villa’s charming staff.<br /> <br /> As a designer beach retreat, Villa Voyage is incomparable. It is particularly suited to couples, groups of friends and extended families, and will be appreciated by lovers of design aesthetics and effortless chic.</p>]]></Description>

 Villa Voyage is an imposing double-height pavilion oriented along the beachfront to make the most of the magnificent sea vistas &ndash; 26 metres of bi-fold and sliding doors open onto a spacious ironwood deck with free-form infinity pool, beyond which turquoise-tipped breakers claim the fine white sand. The open-plan living area takes up the lion&rsquo;s share of the pavilion. At one end is the dining area, bar and guests&rsquo; kitchen and, beyond, the chef&rsquo;s kitchen; at the opposite end is the master bedroom suite and a second bedroom suite. Stairs lead to the mezzanine level where a galleried walkway overlooking the sitting area below leads to the two mezzanine ocean suites at either end.<br />
 <br />
 A separate pavilion set in the garden within the villa&rsquo;s walled compound houses the fifth bedroom suite, and a third discreetly placed building by the villa&rsquo;s entrance is used as staff quarters.</p>]]></Description>
