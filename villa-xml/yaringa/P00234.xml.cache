      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Yaringa is a chic, bright, three-bedroom holiday escape set along the sands of tranquil Natai Beach. While found far from the crowds in lush Phang Nga province, the villa is just a 30-minute drive from Phuket airport.</p><p>Glorious views of the Andaman Sea are revealed from the moment you step into the villa and are shared by every room. Expansive indoor and outdoor living areas ease you into holiday bliss and provide plenty of space to entertain in style. The open-plan kitchen and dining room is a large, airy space all the more inviting with sliding glass doors that open directly out to the terrace. Each of the three ensuite bedrooms is a spacious retreat, with two bathrooms including double jacuzzi tubs.</p><p>Outside, in the immaculate beachfront gardens, a sunken lounge and sala offer dining and relaxing space, surrounded by a generous sunbathing terrace topped with chic double sunbeds.

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Yaringa offers a true escape from the world, but those who wish to venture out and explore beyond the villa will find plenty to see and do in the Natai Beach area. Here are just a few of our suggestions for activities and sights that are within easy reach.</p><ul><li>Dive in and discover the colourful underwater world at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Similan islands</span>, a protected archipelago with colourful coral beds and exotic fishes. Even the occasional whale shark and sea turtle have been spotted in the crystal clear waters. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Diving and snorkelling trips</span> are available when the islands are open from 15 October through 15 May.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Phang Nga Bay</span> is the iconic seascape of dreams with its steep karst islands, floating village and hidden lagoons. There are many ways to explore the bay, whether it be aboard a luxury yacht, a traditional long-tail boat or by paddling a sea kayak.</li><li>Enjoy close encounters with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thailand’s wildlife</span>, safely and ethically, at two animal shelters on Phuket. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phuket Elephant Sanctuary</span> cares for elephants retired from the tourist trade and visitors can watch them at play in the jungle. Nearby <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gibbon Rehabilitation Project</span> is a shelter for rescued gibbons, and some of the cute furry apes can be seen hanging around in their large enclosures at Khao Phra Thaeo national park.</li><li>If the kids somehow tire of exploring the endless sands and sea of Natai Beach, they could try a day of waterslide action at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Splash Jungle water park</span> near Mai Khao Beach on Phuket, or visit <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anthem Wake Park</span> for a freshwater-lake wakeboarding session or indoor wall climbing at the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Rebel Rock Climbing</span> centre next door.</li><li>Natai Beach is home to some excellent upmarket <span style="font-weight: bold;">dining spots</span> including the stylish Baba Beach Club and Aleenta resort, found along the beach just a short drive away from the villa. And for a more easy-going beachfront dining experience, go for Thai food at Rabiang Lay restaurant with its bamboo huts shaded by casuarina trees.&nbsp; </li><li>Golf enthusiasts have a choice of<span style="font-weight: bold;"> scenic golf courses</span> to play in the area, including the Thai Navy-run Tab Lamu course and over the bridge in Phuket are the lovely Mission Hills and Blue Canyon clubs. </li><li>Explore the <span style="font-weight: bold;">natural wonders of the Andaman coast</span> with visits to waterfall parks, river rafting adventures and ATV rides through the lush jungle terrain of Phang Nga province. Bring the camera for an early-morning visit to Samet Nangshe viewpoint, with breath-taking sunrise views over Phang Nga Bay.</li><li>Take a stroll around the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phuket Old Town</span> with its restored Sino-Portuguese buildings, vibrant local food scene, eye-catching wall murals and boutique shops to explore. </li><li>Join a <span style="font-weight: bold;">cookery class</span> to learn the tricks for preparing authentic Thai cuisine, with some courses including an immersive shopping trip to a local market. Some nearby resorts including Aleenta, the JW Marriott Phuket resort on Mai Khao Beach and The Slate hotel at Nai Yang Beach offer Thai cooking classes.</li><li>There’s no shortage of places to <span style="font-weight: bold;">shop in Phuket</span>, with a range of retail choices. The streets of Patong Beach turn into busy street bazaars in the evenings, while the large Jungceylon shopping centre offers a less chaotic and cooler place to shop. Phuket Town is a shopping haven with its bustling Naka Weekend Market, Old Town Sunday street market and Central Festival mall. Boat Plaza near Bang Tao Beach is a good place to wine and dine and browse the upscale shops for beachwear, artwork, jewellery and more.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Holiday villas offer an appealing escape for families, with plenty of space to play and relax in privacy, and a dedicated team of staff who make guests of all ages feel welcome. </p><p>Villa Yaringa is no exception, with a spectacular swimming pool and an idyllic oceanfront setting at Natai Beach with endless sands for early morning jogs, evening strolls and sand-castle building. Toddlers will need to be watched, however, as the pools and beach access are unfenced. The villa’s comfortable indoor and outdoor living areas are great for family-time, while each bedroom has a TV and a day bed or sofa. </p><p>Having a personal chef on site offers a welcome relief from cooking duties, and family dining preferences can be accommodated - whether that means preparing dishes that the picky eater might be tempted to try or arranging for a festive barbecue feast on the terrace. If families do wish to prepare their own meals or snacks, the kitchen is large, well equipped and conveniently situated. </p><p>Travelling can be cumbersome for families, which is why Yaringa is already equipped with a high chair and baby cot. Other high-quality kids equipment can be hired on your behalf from reputable local agencies - just let us know what you need in advance. A babysitter can also be organised for a small extra charge should parents fancy a night out. </p><p>The area surrounding Natai Beach offers many unforgettable adventures for explorers of all ages. Snorkelling among a rainbow of exotic fishes or walking along jungle paths are just a few holiday activities that will captivate. Be sure to consult with the villa manager to ask about local tours and attractions suitable for children, and check our Things to Do page for more ideas, many of which are family-friendly.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Dining at Villa Yaringa is an excellent chance to explore the palate-pleasing flavours of Thai cuisine, with the talented villa chef leading the way.&nbsp; Food is such a deep-rooted, central part of life in Thailand that a common greeting is not so much “How are you?” but rather “Have you eaten yet?” Opening the villa menu, then, is to take the first few steps of a journey into the heart of Thai culture.</p><p>The menu offers a tantalising choice of Thai cuisine that can be tailored to suit your group’s tastes and dietary requirements.&nbsp; Dishes are usually shared, allowing everyone try a variety of flavours such as fiery tom yum prawn soup, a rich and many-textured gai pad med ma-muang (chicken stirfry with cashew nut and chili), or a fresh and spicy yum som-o (pomelo salad), just to name a few.&nbsp; Selections of Asian and Western dishes are also available, as well as a choice of wine, beer and other drinks.</p><p>Groceries are charged at market price plus a 20% handling fee and a government tax, with a minimum shopping fee of THB 750.&nbsp; Guests are requested to provide grocery money in advance, and the staff will do the shopping and keep the receipts for reference.&nbsp; To ensure the chef has ample time to prepare, guests are encouraged to plan meals at least a day in advance.</p>]]></Description>
