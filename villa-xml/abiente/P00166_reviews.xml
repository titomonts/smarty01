    <RHighlight>Villa Abiente’s setting in a lesser-travelled area of Phuket offered us the chance to enjoy the island’s local flavour.&nbsp; We loved watching the long-tail fishing boats glide through the bay off the nearby beach, which was free of tourists.&nbsp; And the sunrises are unforgettable!</RHighlight>

    <ROverallComments>Abiente is a superb holiday villa for active, modern couples and groups of friends, with its chic styling and setting on Phuket’s east coast, on the doorstep of the region’s best sites for yachting, kayaking and other outdoor adventures.&nbsp; For those of us with less ambitious holiday plans, it’s also a fine place to do absolutely nothing but relax poolside and bask in the tropical sun!&nbsp; The open-plan layout invited us to gather, relax and flit between the cool white interior and the pool with ease.&nbsp; Each of the three bedrooms is similarly designed and furnished with king-sized beds and TVs, though only two enjoy a sea view and poolside setting – so there might have to be a coin-toss on arrival.&nbsp; We were among the first to visit this newly built villa (mid-2017) and loved its bright and welcoming ambiance with a no-fuss minimalist edge and a few touches of whimsy here and there including a big mural splashed across the entry hall.&nbsp; Abiente is among the newer villas in Baan Yamu, a decade-old estate with exceptional guest facilities available including a well-equipped gym, which we didn’t try out (lazy!), and the huge 75-metre pool, a good option for serious swimmers.</ROverallComments>
    <RUnpleasantSurprise>Neighbouring villas are in view from Abiente so it doesn’t feel like a complete hideaway, though it’s shielded enough to offer a reasonable level of privacy.&nbsp; Guests with young children will need to keep a close watch on them as there’s no safety fencing around the pool. </RUnpleasantSurprise>

    <ROverallComments>We had the most wonderful time here at villa Abiente. The view, the food and the people made us feel so welcomed and at home. Wonderful memories made. Between the stunning views, gorgeous pool and beautiful grounds. The villa staff and chef ensure that our every need was catered to. From the authentic Thai food we enjoyed at home, to organizing little excursion for us (with a baby). This was definitely a holiday to remember. A big shout out to the staff who were most attentive and ensured all our needs were catered to. Also a positive experience.from the time we confirmed our reservation to the moment we left the villa. Thank you!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Thanks for the awesome and extremely attentive services in the past three days. Our chef is amazing and she basically fulfilled all our meal requests. Food was good and perfectly presented. Another housekeeper was very helpful and meticulous toward the villa cleanliness and tidiness. All in all, we had very pleasant experience and will definitely be back in the future. Thanks for making my bachelorette party an unforgettable one. My girl friends and I couldn't be more happy throughout our entire trip!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>First of all, I would like to say thanks to Kob and Ying to give me such a great honeymoon beginning.
During my stay the food, the environment, the services, everything matches my requirement, especially the food I like it so much. Kob always keeps the house clean and tidy. After they know it is my honeymoon, they even set up a honeymoon room which I like it very much. Hope to see you next time.

    <ROverallComments>We had amazing 4 days break at villa Abiente. The property is gorgeous. The staff are friendly and accommodating. The manager is sufficient and professional. Ying and Kob are wonderful ladies and took good care of us and our stomachs. We didn't take long to feel at home here and will definitely think about returning or trying out their other properties in the Cape Residence. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Ying and Kob, you are the best for taking care of us for 8 days! You are wonderful. I wish I can stay longer in Villa Abiente. Rooms are always really clean and tidy. Food is great. Ying is amazing that she can cook all kinds of nice and yummy dishes. I can swear that the best food I have in Phuket is what Ying cooked for us. This is not my first time staying in the villa that is run by Elite Havens group and their villas don't let you down at all. Always spacious and luxurious!
