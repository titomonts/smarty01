      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Perfectly positioned to catch the sunrise, and with sea views from nearly every room, the three-bedroomed Villa Abiente is an ideal holiday choice for those looking to escape the crowds. Found on Cape Yamu, this modern east-coast sanctuary features a 12-metre pool, bright open-plan living spaces, a fully equipped kitchen and lavish bedroom suites.</p><p>Just 30 minutes away from Phuket International Airport, Villa Abiente is among a collection of private luxury homes in the Baan Yamu estate, which also features a glittering Olympic-sized swimming pool and gym for guests, plus a restaurant and bar just a short walk away from the villa. Unlike many of its more established west-coast cousins, Abiente lies off the tourist track and retains an exclusive getaway feel. Rubber and coconut plantations dominate the surrounding landscape and traditional long-tail fishing boats glide across the bay. This is the perfect place to discover Phuket’s lesser-visited charms.  </p><p>Back at the villa, a stylish, bright living and dining area, incorporating a well-equipped kitchen and breakfast bar, opens to a wraparound balcony, sunken outdoor lounge and pool terrace that optimises the sea views and tropical breezes. A media room tucked behind the living area can also serve as a child’s bedroom and comes with its own bathroom. The villa’s master suite and two guest bedrooms are stylish havens with king-sized beds and private bathrooms. Two of the bedrooms are poolside and boast sea views.  </p><p>Guests are treated to the Thai hospitality and professional service of a team of friendly staff including a chef for all meals and a villa manager who will help arrange cars, taxis and bookings for island attractions including yacht charters around majestic Phang Nga Bay, golf tee-off times, day spas and dining reservations.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Abiente offers a lavish holiday retreat for families, especially for those with older children. Kids will love splashing around in the villa’s private 12-metre pool and letting off steam with games on the lawn. But should extra space or new playmates be sought, there’s always the huge communal pool near the estate entrance. Inside, Villa Abiente has ample entertainment choices for families with each ensuite bedroom and the living room equipped with a flat-screen TV. In the cosy media room (which has its own ensuite bathroom) is a TV and a sofabed, so the space can easily be converted into an extra child’s bedroom if needed. </p><p>A skilled team of staff, including a chef, is on hand all day to cater exclusively to your family’s needs. The villa’s menu offers a fine introduction to Thai food, with several family friendly choices. The chef and villa manager will gladly discuss all your dining requirements and will help customise meals to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. There’s also a fully equipped guest kitchen available for families who wish to prepare their own snacks or meals.</p><p>Villa Abiente is well located for families who wish to explore Phuket’s marine attractions, with the spectacular Phang Nga Bay just to the east of Cape Yamu. The beach closest to the villa isn’t ideal for swimming, but families will enjoy leisurely walks along the promenade, with great sunset views across the bay. And at the nearby pier, longtail boats, speedboats and kayaks are available for hire to explore the calm waters and nearby islands. Some of island’s best nature attractions including Bang Pae Waterfall, the Gibbon Rehabilitation centre and the Phuket Elephant Sanctuary are just minutes away from the villa, too. For more activity choices, be sure to check our <a href="./the-locale/things-to-do.html" target="_self" title="Things to do - Villa Abiente">Things to do</a> page, or ask the villa staff about their insights on family friendly attractions around the island. </p>]]></Description>
