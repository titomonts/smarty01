      <Description><![CDATA[<p>If you relish the idea of getting away from the crowd and reigning over an almost deserted beach in a quieter, less developed part of Bali, then Villa Puri Nirwana could be a right royal match. This six-bedroom villa is among just a handful of beachfront residences in the traditional rural village of Cucukan hugging the coast half way between Sanur and Candidasa on Bali’s south-eastern shore. <br /></p><p>Nirwana is an apt name for this rather grand contemporary villa, its plantation-shuttered facade gleaming in the sunshine in stark contrast to the black-sand beach beyond the swimming pool. Here, it is easy to shrug off stress and sink into a state of happiness, soothed by the sea breeze and sound of breaking surf. There’s breathing space for a full house of up to 20 guests in six spacious bedrooms, with multiple living areas spread over two levels, a media room, poolside beach-edge gazebos, and even a dedicated spa.</p><p>Take a stroll along the beach, slip into the poolside jacuzzi, sprawl in the raised balé, and enjoy spa therapy in the ornately carved teak wood<span style="font-style: italic;"> joglo</span>. Slink along the colonnaded verandas channeling Somerset Maugham colonial ennui, then soak away the day’s (in)activity with a flower-filled bath. Gather for sunset cocktails on the terrace followed by a gourmet candlelit meal crafted by the ex-Mozaic villa chef at the gargantuan dining table. Then after port and cigars around the pool table, retire to your sumptuous suite for dream-filled slumber.</p><p>The fully staffed Puri Nirwana is picture-perfect for family gatherings, fancy celebrations and intimate weddings. Best of all, no need to leave anyone out; the entire estate is wheelchair-friendly, with wide corridors and doors, garden ramps and even an elevator.<br /><br />Isn’t that heaven?</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Puri Nirwana rises on the edge of a beach of black volcanic sand in Cucukan, a traditional Balinese village 20km from Sanur on Bali’s south-eastern coast. Here, the rhythm of life remains largely unchanged across generations:<span style="font-style: italic;"> jukungs</span> (brighty coloured fishing outriggers) rest on the shore, farmers tend their rice fields, and at night the sea breeze carries the percussive beat of the gamelan. Beyond the garden, a paved promenade lines the beach from the Tukad Pakerisan river mouth to Pura Masceti, one of Bali’s nine sacred directional temples and site of many ceremonies. The views are breathtaking – across the bay towards Gunung Agung rising in the distance, and across the ocean to the mountain outline of Nusa Penida on the horizon. This stretch of coastline is popular with surfers – one of Bali’s best surf spots is a few minutes’ drive away – but strong currents make it unsafe for swimming; best to head to the sheltered lagoon waters of Sanur a short drive away along the bypass which also accords easy access to myriad attractions in the area – the closest, Bali Safari Park, being just a five-minute drive away.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Puri Nirwana’s staff has a wealth of information about places of interest and things to do close to the villa and will happily help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Here’s a taste of the many and varied activities on offer:</p><ul><li>The stretch of beach between Sanur and Ketewel is well known as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">surfer’s heaven </span>(especially from November to May, when the winds turn offshore on this side of the island), but beginners should beware of strong, swirling currents. Good breaks can be found at Keramas, Ketewel and Cucukan.</li><li>Bali <span style="font-weight: bold;">Safari &amp; Marine Park</span> offers a fun family day out. Home to hundreds of amazing animals representing more than 50 species, it presents a tram ride through the animal enclosures, a marine aquarium, a theatre, animal educational and entertainment shows, as well as the Fun Zone where visitors can get wet and wild in the Waterpark or embark on a Jungle Cruise.</li><li>If you’ve always dreamt of galloping along the beach at sunset, now’s your chance. Saba Bay stables, can arrange <span style="font-weight: bold;">horse riding trails</span> along the black sands and crashing waves at nearby Saba Beach, passing bamboo and alang-alang plantations and local temples.</li><li>You’re just a 20-minute drive from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">historical village of Sanur</span>, Bali’s original tourist enclave. Its lovely broad expanse of golden sands sheltered by a reef makes this for the perfect spot for safe swimming. Make the most of the diverse array of water sports available and some excellent eating places along the five-kilometre seafront promenade. Golfers, note there’s a nine-hole golf course at the Bali Beach Hotel.</li><li>An annual international<span style="font-weight: bold;"> kite festival</span> takes place at Padang Galak beach (just north of Sanur) every July. Traditional Balinese giant kites up to ten metres in length are made and flown competitively by teams from different villages around Bali. Originally, these kites were intended to send a message to the Hindu Gods to create abundant crops and harvests.</li><li>Don’t miss a trip up to Bali’s <span style="font-weight: bold;">cultural and artistic hub, Ubud</span>. This is the best place to catch traditional Balinese dance performances – especially at the town’s Royal Palace, magically illuminated at night. Ubud has also recently evolved as an upmarket destination, boasting cutting-edge restaurants like Mozaic and world-class spas such as award-winning Como Shambhala.</li><li>You can purchase plenty of arts, crafts and souvenirs in Ubud, but why not get them at source, at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">traditional artisan villages </span>close to the villa: Celuk, famous for silverware; Batubulan for stone carvings; Mas for wood carvings and Sukawati, for its arts and crafts market.</li><li>The villages in the surrounding area contain dozens of examples of beautiful <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hindu Temples.</span> Most temples are free to visit or ask for a small donation. Proper attire is required, although many temples will loan or rent a sarong for your visit. </li><li>Just off the mainland are the islands of Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida – both famous for their <span style="font-weight: bold;">scuba diving and snorkelling</span>, with excellent dive sites and rich marine life. Boat trips from Sanur or Padangbai can easily be arranged. Further along the east coast, Amed and Tulamben offer isolated reefs – the latter, also has shipwreck diving.</li><li>Fashionistas and shop-a-holics should drive over to the west coast where you’ll find Bali’s most <span style="font-weight: bold;">cosmopolitan enclave, Seminyak.</span> Here, indulge in globally inspired gourmet restaurants, stylish boutiques and hip bars including Ku Dé Ta, on Seminyak beachfront.</li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Nirwana is a state of perfect happiness, an idyllic place. It’s the perfect name for this patch of paradise poised by a black-sand beach on the edge of Cucukan, a traditional Balinese village on the island’s south-eastern shore. Villa Puri Nirwana dazzles with its sweeping sea vistas and stunning contemporary-colonial architecture —colonnaded verandas, highly decorated ceilings, acres of marble floor, plantation shuttered windows, light-filled interiors, and profound sense of space that invokes heritage hotels and bygone days of grand travel. Flitting through shaded corridors are smartly uniformed staff, ever ready with an ice-cold towel, refreshing drink and ready smile. </p><p>Somerset Maugham would have felt quite at home here, gazing through the row of Casuarina trees lining the beach across the ocean to Nusa Penida rising on the horizon. 21st Century travelers will welcome more contemporary luxuries: supremely comfortable beds in all six suites, air-conditioning even in the stately ensuite bathrooms, a media room and gourmet kitchen.</p><p>It’s easy to slip into a transcendent state in such a blissful setting. Start the day with an early morning stroll along the promenade, meeting fishermen with their catch as Gunung Agung’s mystical peak appears above the clouds. Spend mornings by the pool, mesmerised by the breakers foaming on the shore. In the heat of the day retreat to the upper level lounge to play pool or just relax in the sea breeze. Enjoy an afternoon siesta or massage in the ornately carved <span style="font-style: italic;">joglo</span> spa. In the early evening cool, savour the sunset with a cocktail in the raised beach-edge balé, serenaded by the surf and cicadas. Then gather around the gargantuan dining table for a gourmet dinner prepared by the accomplished villa chef. </p><p>Rest, recharge, renew. Repeat. How can it get any better?</p>]]></Description>

Two are on the garden level and two are upstairs, reached by a staircase and – a rarity in Bali villas — an elevator. In each, the bed rests under an ornately decorated ceiling, with a queen-size trundle bed tucked away underneath — ideal for families with young kids, of four kids sharing a room.

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want is just one of the many family-friendly advantages of a villa holiday. Parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests.</p><p>Villa Puri Nirwana is a great villa for families. Older kids will relish the beachfront swimming pool, media room with Playstation, pool table, and lawn for kicking a ball around. There’s a shallow pool section and pool toys for younger ones, who will also love the sandpits in the garden. However there are unfenced ponds, and parents will also need to keep a close eye on the beach which is great for building castles in the cool of the day, but not for swimming because of strong currents.</p><p>The team of friendly staff at Puri Nirwana will make children feel as welcome as adults, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost).</p><p>Although the equipped kitchen allows you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will happily to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the chef and they will take care of the rest. Banana pancakes for breakfast? Fish fingers for a poolside lunch? No problem. The chef can customise all meals to suit children’s taste buds.</p><p>Don’t worry about packing all that cumbersome kids’ equipment for your stay. Just let us know what you need, and anything we don’t have in-house (villa facilities include a baby cot and highchair) we can hire on your behalf (click here to see list of available hire items).</p><p>And when the excitement of exploring the villa starts to wear off, check out our Things to do page; there’s plenty in the area to keep all of the family amused throughout the holiday.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Enjoying the attentions of your own talented chef is one of the delights of a private villa vacation, freeing you to appreciate delicious breakfasts, lunches and dinners (plus snacks in between) without lifting a finger. Puri Nirwana offers an extensive suggestion menu catering to all tastes as well as a series of reasonably priced set menus, served home-style. Italian, Chinese, Asian – the chef can whip up many popular dishes, but is happiest sharing his love for Balinese fare – yellow rice, <span style="font-style: italic;">urab, lawar, ikan pepes, satay</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">ayam betutu</span>. And he will happily oblige if you crave something off-menu, or have special dietary requirements. Linger over a light poolside lunch, move from sunset to stars with a seafood barbecue – the catch-of-the-day provided by the village fishermen. Or enjoy a formal multi-course feast served at the enormous dining table in air-conditioned comfort.

Groceries and beverages are charged at cost price plus 20%++, which covers government taxes and a service fee, and staff will keep all receipts for reference at the end of your stay.&nbsp; <br /></p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>With an excellent choice of formal and casual living areas, guests at Puri Nirwana can gather together in comfort with space to spare, or retreat to quiet corners away from the crowd. </p><p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">formal living room </span>is bright and breezy, with a wall of glass doors opening onto a sun-drenched terrace. Upholstered sofas and chairs cluster around a large coffee table, encouraging genial conversation. Leading off is a gallery lined with glass-fronted cabinets containing the owner’s curios and collectibles.</p><p>Above is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">colonial-style living room</span> sprawling under a soaring four-pillar teakwood <span style="font-style: italic;">joglo</span> core. Here, plantation shutters filter the sea breeze or can be flung open to make the most of the fabulous 180-degree ocean vista. Languish on the four-poster daybed, or convene around the semi-circular sofa for a sunset cocktail. Those happy to sleep without air-conditioning can also have this room made up as a bedroom; there is an ensuite shower room and a long vanity with double basins. </p><p>Also on the second level is a breezy <span style="font-weight: bold;">open-sided lounge</span> protected to one side by a bank of plantation shutters, with pool table, and dining table for six commanding stunning sea views through a trio of open arches.</p><p>Running the length of the main pavilion is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">formal dining room</span>, oriented to the ocean views beyond a wall of glass doors that can be closed for air-conditioned comfort or opened to the breeze. Dominating this space is a monumental table formed from the cross-section of a massive tree, which seats 16 in supreme comfort, and up to 20 without a squeeze. </p><p>Sandwiched between the dining room and the professional kitchen, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">media room</span> is a magnet for guests of all ages who seek the pleasures of a movie or Sony Playstation in air-conditioned comfort. Sit back on a soft sofa or recliner with a magazine, browse through Indosat’s many TV channels, or choose a DVD and settle in front of the 55-inch TV. Or simply lie back and admire the traditional <span style="font-style: italic;">Kamasan</span> paintings adorning the ceiling.</p><p>The<span style="font-weight: bold;"> kitchen </span>is huge, well equipped and features dual gas ovens, hot plates, a glass storeroom and twin state-of-the-art refrigerators. It’s the domain of the chef, but guests are welcome to make full use of it too should the urge take them.</p>  ]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>With its prime oceanfront location, it’s no surprise that the beach is the focus of the Puri Nirwana’s outdoor living space. The villa’s social hub is the 16-metre <span style="font-weight: bold;">swimming pool</span> with jacuzzi and shallow section for smaller kids – and nothing to separate it from the beach except for a low glass fence. Standing sentinel at either end is a raised <span style="font-weight: bold;">balé,</span> deeply cushioned for daytime siestas and people-watching, and a vine-covered<span style="font-weight: bold;"> gazebo</span> backed by a tropical jungle scene wall, with clusters of seating providing alfresco dining for 12. In between, over-sized bean bags rest on an ironwood deck under a row of towering palm trees and traditional Balinese parasols.</p><p>By the villa entrance is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">colonnaded veranda</span> where rattan chairs invite repose. Within the landscaped gardens is a children’s play area with sand pits and castle-building toys, and a performance area where local villagers can be invited to perform traditional dances or play <span style="font-style: italic;">gamelan </span>before the serene backdrop of a massive Buddha face.</p> ]]></Description>
