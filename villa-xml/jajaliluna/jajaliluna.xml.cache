      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Jajaliluna’s manager, Wayan, has a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Many of them live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.</p><p>In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.</p><ul><li>Bali boasts hundreds of ancient temples (pura): at Petitenget Beach entrance (1km), <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pura Dalem Petitenget</span> appears unassuming, but is actually one of the island’s key temples, with sixteenth century origins. Considered sacred (and associated with ghostly tales), visitors should be respectfully attired to enter. Regular colourful ceremonies are held here, or on the holy area of beach opposite.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stylish nightspots</span> are within staggering distance, located both in Petitenget and Seminyak. Amongst all the hip bars, don’t miss one of Asia’s most famed beach clubs, Ku Dé Ta, on Seminyak beachfront – an absolute must for sunset cocktails. Seminyak also boasts superb shopping, with designer boutiques, antique stores, art galleries and more.</li><li>The most exclusive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali trekking tour</span> promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href="http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title="Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise.">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise.</a></li><li>Jet-lagged and can’t sleep? Need to glam-up before a big night out or pamper yourself after one? Jajaliluna is surrounded by <span style="font-weight: bold;">world-class spas </span>but Away Spa, at W Retreat Bali, a short stroll away, is one of Bali’s most glamorous and lavish, and is open 24 hours a day.</li><li>A string of <span style="font-weight: bold;">beaches </span>renowned for their excellent surf breaks are easily accessible along this south-west coastline and are all in prime position for fabulous sunsets. Head to legendary surfer’s haunt, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Echo Beach </span>(8km) which conveniently provides post-surf sunset drinking.</li><li>Alternatively, if you want to <span style="font-weight: bold;">learn to surf,</span> head down to the Double Six section of Legian Beach, home to Rip Curl School of Surf. With the surf school’s long experience and Legian’s manageable waves and warm, sandy-bottomed seas, this is a great spot for novice surfers, and for excellent brunches at one of the beachfront restaurants.</li><li>With a five star International rating, certified international instructors and over 40 school horses including school masters, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Equestrian Centre</span> is a world-class destination for both riders and tourists. The facilities have been designed to accommodate the entire family - pony rides and day camps for the little ones, lessons, family village tours and beach rides. After riding there is a beautiful architecturally designed restaurant, pool area and playground to be enjoyed by all.</li><li>Adrenaline junkies and adventure seekers can get their fix white water rafting down the Ayung River north of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ubud</span>, while culture vultures can head into Ubud’s town centre and explore the traditional market and wonderful art galleries.</li><li>Make the de rigueur pilgrimage to sacred<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Pura Tanah Lot</span> (18km), one of Bali’s biggest tourist magnets. Perched high on a craggy wave-lashed rock, this ancient sea temple is best savoured at sunset; make sure you receive a blessing from the resident Hindu Priests.</li><li>To escape the crowds, drive westwards past Tanah lot, heading for the relatively unchartered West Bali region. Here, the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan Regency</span> reveals terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black sand beaches dotted with fishing communities – archetypal landscape for which Bali is famed.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Treetop Adventure Park </span>is near the town of Bedugal in northern central Bali (next to Lake Bratan). Five adventure circuits, with heights ranging from two to 20 metres, challenge all level and ages on suspended bridges, spider nets, Tarzan jumps and 12 flying foxes.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pulau Dive Charters </span>offers luxury boat charters around the beautiful islands and waters surrounding Bali. They specialise in private fishing, surfing and diving charters and also offer unique personalised day trips to Nusa Lembongan. Perfect for a family day out on the water or with a group of friends.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ul>]]></Description>

 Just 500 metres from Seminyak Beach and a short stroll to the island&rsquo;s most famous restaurants, bars, spas and boutiques, Villa Jajaliluna is a food lover and shopper&rsquo;s dream location. The villa is situated just off Jalan Laksmana, Bali&rsquo;s &lsquo;Eat St&rsquo;, where you will find every type of cuisine possible &ndash; Italian, Japanese, Moroccan, Indian and traditional Indonesian warungs.<br />
 <br />
 The wide, black, sandy beach near the villa stretches north and south as far as the eye can see, and is perfect for running, walking, building sandcastles and, of course, lazing in the sun. Sun beds with umbrellas can be hired from local vendors, but if you want a more luxurious experience head to the string of five-star hotels that offer five-star beachside service. At sunset, Seminyak Beach is alive with locals and holidaymakers savouring the magical moments as the sun goes down. There are plenty of surf breaks, but swimming is permitted only between the flags due to strong currents.</p>

 Designed by acclaimed Bali-based company Glen Parker Architects, this symmetrical villa combines crisp modern lines with traditional finishes to create a chic and elegant home.<br />
 <br />
 Guests enter the villa via a Palimanan stone walkway bordered by high walls and hibiscus which leads to a large wooden cantilevered door and a compact garden courtyard. Stepping stones traverse a pond flanked either side by fire bowls and a small lawn planted with coconut trees, to present a central T-shaped swimming pool and Jajaliluna&rsquo;s three living pavilions. &nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 Closest to the entrance lies the open-plan living/kitchen pavilion which overlooks the pool deck. Symmetrically opposite is the media room and outdoor dining terrace. The main two-storey pavilion, comprising four bedrooms and two living areas, languishes along the far side of the pool, facing west to maximise the sunset views.</p>
