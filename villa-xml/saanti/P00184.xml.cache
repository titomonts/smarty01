      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Saanti is Thai for &quot;Home of Peace&quot;. This extraordinary six-bedroom, fully staffed beachfront villa lounges next to one of Thailand’s most alluring secrets: Natai Beach – seven kilometres of near-deserted, powder-soft white sand, only 30 minutes to the north of Phuket International Airport. </p>The entrance into Villa Saanti is through a modest garden dominated by a serene statue of the Buddha, seated with offerings of flowers, incense and candles before him. As you step through the villa’s main doorway, you are greeted by a spectacular vista that leads your eye from the cool interior of the living pavilion, across the shady terrace, along 20 metres of blissful infinity-edge swimming pool, between towering palm trees and on, to the sparkling waters of the Andaman Sea. <br /><p>This stunning designer-chic home is run by Wow (an appropriate name for the manager of a villa with a definite wow factor) and his full-time team – the chef, two housekeepers and the gardener – all ready to satisfy your slightest whim.</p>The villa’s interiors are decorated in a rich chocolate brown and provide a restful escape for those who want to relax quietly after a couple of hours in the pool or on the beach, sinking into the soft-cushioned sofas of the lounge or watching a movie on the huge TV in the entertainment room.<br /><p>And after a spectacular sunset over the Andaman Sea, for which the villa has ringside seats, after an invariably excellent dinner, and after digestifs sipped under the brilliance of a billion stars unspoiled by urban lighting, it’s time to drift into a dreamless sleep in&nbsp; Villa Saanti’s deeply comfortable bedrooms.</p>This is what true peace is.]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Saanti faces west across the Andaman Sea, its two-storey main pavilion and four glass-walled sleeping pavilions framing two huge swimming pools, and looking out across palm-dominated gardens to the beach. Entering the main pavilion, you find the dining and guest kitchen area on the left and the lounge on the right. Beyond the lounge is the media and entertainment room. Upstairs is the huge master suite and a guestroom, and in front of all this is an enormous shady terrace and the 20-metre main pool, which spills into a second pool - looking out over the garden. And beyond the garden is the glorious deserted beach.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Saanti lies next to the delightfully deserted Natai Beach in southern Thailand’s beautiful Phang Nga province, just north of Phuket. This blissful beachfront villa has six bedrooms, all ensuite, and can accommodate up to 18 people. The spacious two-storey main pavilion and four luxurious bedroom pavilions surround two large infinity-edge swimming pools. Beyond is the palm-fringed garden and then the beach and azure waters of the Andaman Sea. The villa is ideal for a large family gathering or a holiday for a group of friends, and the professional staff team, which includes a skilled Thai chef, ensures a perfect stay for everyone from tots to grandparents.</p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[Meals at Villa Saanti are served, unless otherwise requested, at a long, elegant 12-seat table in the dining area on the ground floor of the main pavilion. A second dining table on the veranda, can seat eight people.<br /><br />To the far side of the dining room is a well-equipped guest kitchen for those who enjoy a little therapeutic holiday cookery (though with a skilled chef in residence, perhaps not unsurprisingly, few actually do). There is also an excellent coffee machine and wine cooler here to ensure the red, white or rosé is always at the perfect temperature.<br /><br />Next to the dining area is the über-comfortable living room, the place for snoozing or reading through shady afternoons, or for relaxed conversation after dinner amid the chocolate brown décor and furnishings dominated by an antelope skin rug and a huge bird cage. <br /><br />Next door to that is the entertainment room, with its 55-inch flat-screen TV, DVD player and satellite receiver or, for the more energetic, the villa’s Wii system. WiFi is available in every room, throughout the villa grounds and onto the beach, and a Sonos sound system allows guests to play their favourite music just about anywhere in the villa. <br /><br />Upstairs, past the master bedroom, is the gym, equipped with rowing, cycling and jogging machines, along with weights and exercise balls.]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[An absolute beachfront holiday in Thailand is all about making the most of the sunshine and the outdoors. With this goal in mind, Villa Saanti is arranged around a huge sand-wash deck furnished with sun loungers, and a barbecue area equipped with a wood-fired pizza oven.<br /><br />Taking pride of place at the centre of the estate are the villa’s two stunning infinity-edge pools. The larger one, measuring 20 x 5 metres, spills into the smaller one, designed for children and jacuzzi lovers, and measuring 12 x 3 metres.<br /><br />To the front of the lawn, under soaring coconut palms (the land on which Villa Saanti stands used to be a coconut plantation), is the beachfront sala, with its sunken seating inviting lazy conversation, reading or just gazing out across the sea to the horizon.<br /><br />Just beyond, on the sand and in the shade of screwpine and sea almond trees, are six more sunbeds and one of the world’s most sublime views – the sapphire-and-emerald sea and cobalt sky.<br /> ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa holidays are by their very nature family-friendly, especially for those with small children, and Villa Saanti, with its predominantly ground-floor layout, wide gardens, swimming pools and beautiful beach with warm shallow sea – is a safe, happy, relaxing environment for kids and their parents.</p>The friendly staff are terrific with children and are often able to help entertain the kids during the day to give mums and dads a little break. Full-time babysitting can also be arranged through your villa manager (extra charges apply). Between the pools, beach, pool table, ping pong table and entertainment room there’s plenty to keep children busy all day without even leaving the villa.<br /><p>No need to use up your luggage allowance on kids’ equipment either. Villa Saanti has a cot, toys and high chairs. Other equipment can be hired locally. Just let us know what you need when you make your reservation and it’ll be waiting for you when you arrive.</p>And if the excitement of playing in the villa or building sandcastles on the beach ever shows any sign of wearing off, check out our Things To Do. There are plenty of sea- and land-based activities around Natai Beach to keep all the family amused. ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Villa Saanti is right next to Natai Beach – quiet, clean and utterly serene. Although Natai is just half an hour’s drive from Phuket International Airport, its seven kilometres of soft golden sand are usually deserted. </p>The villa faces west, towards the Andaman Sea, and every evening, as the sun wheels toward the horizon, the sky puts on a unique and spectacular show of reds, pinks, oranges, greens, lilacs and purples, doubled by the reflections in the sea. When you’re staying at Villa Saanti, you are guaranteed ringside seats.<br /><p>But you are not completely alone. After sunset cocktails and dinner, it’s an easy (less than 1km) stroll along the sand to Baba Beach Club, known for its great music. Or treat yourself to a rejuvenating therapy at The Aleenta Spa, just a little further along the beach. </p>You’re also close to the wonders of Phang Nga Bay, the hot springs of Phang Nga, untouched jungle and, for golfers, Blue Canyon Country Club and Mission Hills on Phuket. Slightly further afield, but still an easy day (or night) out, is the glitz of Patong (1 hour 20 minutes’ drive), and the shops of historic Phuket Old Town (about an hour away).]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>This Natai Beach villa may be a tranquil getaway but that doesn’t mean there’s any lack of things to do. The province of Phang Nga is renowned for its outdoor activities, its deep green forests and the jaw-dropping spectacle of limestone islands rising vertically from the waters of Phang Nga Bay. </p>Villa Saanti’s manager will have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required. Also, do ask the staff about the local area. Many of them live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of life in Phang Nga.<br /><p>Here’s a sampling of things to do in the area:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">River rafting</span> (better between May and October when there’s more water) is sure to get the adrenaline pumping – an exciting way to spend a few hours getting really wet.</li><li><p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phang Nga Bay tour</span> is a must. Visit hongs (rooms) inside the islands, some with their own internal beaches, and canoe through tangled mazes of mangrove forests.</p></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Baba Beach Club</span>. Sophisticated and laid back, with top-class deejays, Baba is just a ten-minute walk along the beach from Villa Saanti. Perfect for a chill-out day or an evening with friends.</li><li><p>For the more energetic, the seven kilometres of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Natai Beach</span>, as deserted as Robinson Crusoe’s domain, beg to be walked. Or for water lovers, follow the shoreline in the villa’s two kayaks.</p></li><li>Take a stroll around <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phuket Old Town</span> for its local food, chic cafés, arts and craft studios, street markets and wall murals, and soak up the colourful atmosphere of the restored Sino-Portuguese buildings and Chinese shrines.</li><li><p>Explore the underground <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phung Chang caves</span> near Phang Nga town, riding through the darkness in a canoe, with only a miner’s lamp on your head to see where you are going.</p></li><li>Just 15 minutes’ drive to the east, at the edge of Phang Nga Bay, is Dinosea World Park. The kids will love the <span style="font-weight: bold;">slides, pools and waterfalls</span>. And as the name suggests, there are enormous dinosaurs everywhere. Perfect for unusually impressive selfies.</li><li><p>For grown-ups, <span style="font-weight: bold;">golfing options</span> are aplenty. There are courses in Phang Nga but serious golfers will probably head for Phuket to play at the world-class Blue Canyon or Mission Hills clubs, both around half an hour’s drive south of Villa Saanti. </p></li><li>Still got energy to burn? Get your villa manager to organise a <span style="font-weight: bold;">mountain bike tour</span>. The tour companies reckon these tours are better off-road, so prepare to get muddy.</li><li><p>Learn all about the tropical environment with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">jungle trek</span> through old-growth natural forest. You can also learn what’s edible and what’s not so that you can survive if you ever get lost in the jungle – a useful skill to take home with you!</p></li></ul>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>The opportunity to stay in a superb luxury private villa on one of Thailand’s few remaining secret stretches of golden sand doesn’t come along every day.</p>One of these whispered-about secrets is Natai Beach on the beautiful Andaman coast, just north of Phuket. And Natai Beach is where you’ll find Villa Saanti – the Villa of Peace. The perfect name for this gorgeous beachfront holiday home.<p></p><p>This six-bedroom villa, with plenty of space for 12 adults and up to six children, embraces two large swimming pools as it gazes across a stretch of lush lawn and sky-yearning coconut palms, to the sublime beach and the Andaman Sea beyond. The sumptuously furnished and air-conditioned living and dining pavilion, offers a cool retreat where guests can rest, relax and enjoy attentive service from a friendly team that includes a knowledgeable villa manager, housekeeping and service staff as well as a skilled Thai chef.</p><p>Carefully raked to perfection every day, the beach is the place for spending lazy days deliciously idling on sun loungers in the shade of screw pines and sea almond trees, taking an occasional dip in the Andaman, its waters as warm as a lover’s welcome.</p><p>When the sun has set – a nightly spectacle for which Villa Saanti has ringside seats – the pools are lit by flickering torches in true tropical style. Enjoy each other’s company as you wait for a feast of fragrant Thai cuisine or a crisp pizza from the wood-fired oven.</p><p>Time afterwards for a Wii game, or a movie on the 55-inch screen in the entertainment room before falling into deeply comfortable beds with the sound of gentle waves kissing the shore. They call, “Sleep now. Tomorrow is another day of delights&quot;.</p>]]></Description>

          <Description><![CDATA[<p>An ancient traditional art, this method of massage was originally administered on temple grounds by masters with healing abilities. By exerting pressure on specific points of the body and by manipulating muscles and ligaments, the spine is elongated and relieved of tension. The sense of wellbeing as energy and flexibility are brought back into your body is extraordinary. </p> ]]></Description>
