 Each of the seven colour-themed bedrooms at Taman Ahimsa is named after a Hindu chakra and boasts a rich array of ornate artisanal fabrics, a hand-selected crystal and a unique gamelan instrument symbolizing charm and balance.<br />
 <br />
 All bedrooms are air-conditioned and furnished with a canopied king size bed, a dressing area with fitted wardrobes, a writing desk, a safe deposit box and a private terrace. Ensuite bathrooms provide a delightful mixture of indoor and outdoor areas with huge hollowed out river-rock tubs, river-rock basins, rain showers, slate paved floors and bamboo ceilings.<br />
 <br />
 The two upstairs bedrooms, Sahasrana and Vissudha, lie adjacent to the TV room and are linked by a bamboo bridge to make an ideal family retreat. Both of these rooms have bamboo balconies at the front with views taking in coconut palms and beyond to the ocean giving them a Robinson Crusoe feel.<br />
 <br />
 The other five bedrooms are privately laid out within Taman Ahimsa&rsquo;s beautiful beachside gardens, including the pride of the fleet, master bedroom Manipura, with its high vaulted ceilings and luxuriously draped 2.3-metre-wide bed.</p>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Staff at Taman Ahimsa have a rich knowledge of the local area and can also advise on places of interest around the island. They can arrange for the driver to take you wherever you would like to go and give you information on where to eat what to see when you are out and about.<br /> <br /> Here is a taste of some of the activities you could indulge in during your stay:</p><ol> <li>  Taman Ahimsa is close to the famous sea temple at <strong>Tanah Lot</strong>. Although renowned for its sunset vistas, going early in the morning provides a better idea of the power of the location and the chance to see it undisturbed, apart from perhaps an offering ceremony.</li> <li>  A nice sunset alternative is to head down to <strong>Echo Beach </strong>where a number of cafés offer good sunset views and cold beer. Hotel Tugu, a very stylish and eclectic boutique hotel a few minutes further down the coast is also a good sunset spot. Note that the beach along this section of the coast is dark volcanic sand and the waters are better suited to surfing than swimming.</li> <li>  Fashionistas, trendies shop-a-holics and foodies should hot-foot it down to <strong>Seminyak</strong>, Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave. Here, you can indulge for hours in the glut of stylish, chic boutiques and international restaurants and bars including, Potato Head Beach club, La Lucciola and Bali’s infamously trendy Ku Dé Ta. For furniture, antiques and homeware stores go for a wander around the streets of nearby <strong>Kerobokan</strong>.</li>  <li>  Drive westwards to explore the charming <strong>Tabanan Regency</strong>, revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to explore the <strong>volcanic lakes </strong>near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu – one of Bali’s most important temples.</li> <li>  Get up to some monkey business at <strong>Bali Treetop Adventure Park </strong>(next to Lake Bratan). Five adventure circuits, with heights ranging from two to 20 metres, challenge all level and ages on suspended bridges, spider nets, tarzan jumps and 12 flying foxes.</li> <li>  Explore the <span style="font-weight: bold;">scenic rice-field landscape and rural villages</span> on one of Taman Ahimsa’s 6 bicycles; a great way to get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali. Stop off at a local warung (café) to sample some basic Balinese fare or cool off with a cold drink.</li> <li>  With its warm seas, almost year-round season, relatively uncrowded beach and reef breaks and suitability for all levels of experience, Bali surfing is world-renowned. The beaches of Canggu (11km) are known for their <strong>world-class surf breaks</strong>, offering exposed reef breaks with consistent surf. May to October (dry season) is the favoured time for waves.</li> <li>  If you are a bold and brave bargain hunter, a spree within the heart of Bali’s bustling provincial capital is an exciting and rewarding experience. Visit the vibrant <strong>Denpasar markets</strong>, where everything and anything is available.</li> <li>The most exclusive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali trekking tour</span> promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href=" http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title="Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. ">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. </a><br /></li> <li>  <strong>Pulau Dive Charters </strong>offers luxury boat charters around the beautiful islands and waters surrounding Bali. They specialise in private fishing, surfing and diving charters and also offer unique personalised day trips to Nusa Lembongan. Perfect for a family day out on the water or with a group of friends.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ol>]]></Description>

The  surrounding ironwood deck, furnished with oversized rattan sunbeds and  umbrellas, is the ideal place to relax after a dip or watch the kids  enjoy themselves in the pool.</p> <p>The thatched poolside pavilion with its outdoor dining for 16 is  perfect for leisurely breakfasts, an alfresco lunch, afternoon tea and  sunset drinks. A barbecue can be set up down here too, either under the  shade of a coconut palm or close to the waterfront to take full  advantage of Bali’s famously spectacular sunsets. The deck area also  doubles as a yoga or martial arts studio.</p> <p>Nestled in the garden and overlooking the ocean, charming thatched <em>balés </em>  provide shady escapes for reading, meditation, private reflection or  just somewhere to lay your head and unwind. Let the staff arrange for a  traditional Balinese masseur to ease away your tensions while you are  lulled by the sound of the rolling waves.</p> ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[The family friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want. Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is a real plus – and one that means parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday too.<br /><br />Taman Ahimsa’s rambling garden makes a magical playground for kids, the perfect place to play hide-and-seek, or even just chase the butterflies. There are plenty of grassy areas to kick a ball around or throw a frisbee. The pool is unfenced but there is no shortage of comfortable places for parents to relax while they watch their toddlers frolic, and pool toys are available on request.<br /><br />If the kids tire of that, the beach is right on your doorstep, lapped by the balmy waters of the Indian Ocean. Here, they can collect shells and build sandcastles, and older kids can venture out in Taman Ahimsa’s two canoes. Parents should be aware that the surf in Bali can be tricky and the beach here is unpatrolled so constant supervision is necessary.<br /><br />During downtime kids can watch one of the many DVDs on the 32-inch plasma screen in the TV room or play with the toys provided.<br /><br />The team of friendly staff at Taman Ahimsa will make children feel as welcome as adults, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost).<br /><br />Although the equipped kitchen allows you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will happily to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest.

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>From the moment you cross the traditional wooden bridge and walk through the boat-inspired bamboo entrance you are transported to a magical oasis at Taman Ahimsa, the ‘Garden of Peace’.<br /><br />The use of organic materials such as alang-alang roofing, coconut husks, bamboo, rattan and recycled wood allows the pavilions to meld into the landscape, enhancing, rather than imposing on, the stunning natural setting. The sprawling, lush gardens, abundant with swaying coconut palms, alive with effervescent splashes of colour from the hibiscus and bougainvillea, and vibrant with birdsong, cascade all the way down to the black-sand beach. Inside, a wonderful selection of Indonesian artefacts, including ornate handmade Balinese fabrics sourced from the hillsides of Ubud, give unique charm and character to every space.<br /><br />Luxuriate under a sunshade by the Java-stone pool and gaze towards Uluwatu, one of Bali’s most sacred temples. Enjoy a massage in a thatched garden balé, or still your thoughts as you gaze over the jade-green ocean. Borrow one of the resort’s bikes and follow the road through the sculpted rice paddies surrounding the charming seaside village of Cemagi. This is unchanged Bali, a land steeped in tradition and the spiritual, where, at any moment, you might stumble upon a colourful ceremony and find yourself in the midst of the exotic and ancient.<br /><br />Step from the poolside decking directly onto the beach, and enjoy cocktails as you watch the sunset. Congregate for meals at the elegant teak dining table and let your taste buds be dazzled by the stunning cuisine prepared by the highly skilled chef and his team. And after dinner, use the villa’s telescope to gaze at the blanket of stars adorning the Balinese night sky.<br /><br />Taman Ahimsa will soothe your senses, invigorate your soul, and provide you with a renewed sense of oneness. At the end of your stay you will literally have to tear yourself away – Taman Ahimsa does not relinquish its guests easily.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p> Taman Ahimsa is located in the wonderfully bucolic seaside village of Cemagi. The villa is approached via rolling lush green rice paddies tended by local farmers. And once at the villa the sweeping views across the ocean to Uluwatu, on Bali’s southernmost tip, are breathtaking. A few short steps and you are on the beach itself, the warm sand between your toes. And unlike the crowded beaches at Kuta or Legian, you will have this one pretty much to yourself!<br /> <br /> If you have the urge to explore, some of the island’s best surf breaks are located within a short drive, including Batu Bolong, Echo Beach and Seseh. And guests should not miss watching the sun set over Tanah Lot, Bali’s most famous and revered temple.<br /> <br /> While there may be some reluctance to leave the beauty and comfort of the villa and all it has to offer, the restaurants and nightlife of Seminyak are only half an hour (15km) away and Taman Ahimsa’s car and driver are at your disposal.</p>]]></Description>

 Entry to Taman Ahimsa is via an intriguing two-storey bamboo-lined structure in the shape of a boat, the lower floor of which houses two open-plan living areas, a state-of-the-art gourmet kitchen and a dining area. Upstairs is the TV room and two bedrooms connected by a wooden bridge which provide ideal accommodation for families.<br />
 <br />
 Stone pathways meander through the lush gardens, past the many lily ponds, connecting the remaining five room pavilions, each of which has an ensuite bathroom and private balcony. Adjacent to the beach is the idyllic pool area, boasting an organically shaped 18 metre pool and thatched poolside pavilion. A series of stone steps lead onto the beach which, apart from the occasional fisherman or village ceremony, is all yours!</p>
