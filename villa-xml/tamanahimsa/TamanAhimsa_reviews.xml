	The beautiful deserted beachside location; the rustic architecture and use of natural materials; the gorgeous gardens and the serenity, all combined to make our stay at Taman Ahimsa a very special and unique experience. Also of note are the staff, who were very sweet, and the healthy juices, which were superb.</p>

	If you choose to stay at Taman Ahimsa, your visit may well be for a yoga or meditation retreat, in which case you probably won&rsquo;t want to go out much at all. There are not many man-made attractions in the neighbourhood, but it is fun to explore the beautiful coastline and countryside by foot or bicycle (there are six bikes available), and the roads are mainly flat and quiet. Five minutes&rsquo; walk up the beach is the small sea temple of Pura Bata Ngandang; it sits on a rocky outcrop and is a bit like a miniature version of the famous Tanah Lot, which is located two or three kilometres further up the coast (9km by road). Heading inland, before you reach the main road, is a village temple, where there always seems to be a lot of colourful activity.</p>

	If you&rsquo;re looking for nightlife and shopping, Taman Ahimsa is probably not the villa for you, but if you want to retreat from the world, awaken your soul, practice yoga and meditation, eat healthy food and experience therapeutic massages, this transformative place will inspire you more than you ever imagined possible. Even if you&rsquo;re not really into the spiritual concept, and you don&rsquo;t understand much about chakras, <em>mandala thankas</em>, crystals and healing circles, you will still appreciate the beautiful close-to-nature setting, the sight and sound of the sea, the romantic architecture and the peaceful ambiance.<br />
	<br />
	Although the villa promotes the holistic concept, you don&rsquo;t have to be on a spiritual retreat to come here; but who knows, you might just be inspired to experience something new. The gardens and interiors are fun to explore too, in every room we found a traditional Balinese instrument, an extraordinary crystal or an antique, or a funky lamp or table. Floors and doors are made from old teak, ironwood and two-toned tamarind wood, which has been recycled from boats and old buildings. Please note the villa has a no smoking policy.<br />
	<br />
	Taman Ahimsa is managed by Fivelements, a company that specialises in holistic healing retreats, centred at Puri Ahimsa, 20km away. For a truly amazing experience arrange for the villa&rsquo;s driver to take you to Fivelements Puri Ahimsa for a holistic treatment performed by an authentic Balinese healer.</p>

    <RUnpleasantSurprise><p>
	The TV room is cosy, but it adjoins one of the bedrooms, so is not the most practical. On the other hand, Taman Ahimsa is not really a TV-watching kind of place. We could have done with some books, games and DVDs though, so remember to bring some with you.</p>

    <ROverallComments>This place is good and in a good quite location. The swimming pool is very big and the open layout nice. Service was very good and the staffs were very helpful. My mother and I love Balinese open style design, so The Ahimsa Villa is perfect. The Ahimsa provides a transfer service, which we used were really helps us to solve all the traveling problems.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>The exact location of the villa is somewhat difficult for taxi drivers to locate especially if you arrive in the evening. The villa itself is extremely beautiful and a great retreat especially if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life and looking for a place to unwind in tranquility. The view from the pool of the beach is breathtaking. The rooms are spacious with a modern yet rural feel. The staff are friendly and cater to your needs. The location is far from Kuta and Seminyak so you will need to use a driver if you want to do shopping but this place is a perfect stay as you can order in and enjoy the facilities the villa has to offer.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>I consider myself pretty well travelled, so it's rare that my breath is completely taken away, but Taman Ahimsa exceeded all expectations. It may be my favourite place on the planet, particularly because of the delightful staff led by Prahma. 

I celebrated my 30th birthday here with eight friends and family and though we had made a number of plans to explore the area, aside from a sunset visit to Tanah Lot (great for holiday snaps) and two dinners out, we did not leave. Get the yoga teachers and masseuses to come to you and kick back by the pool, on the day beds, and bury yourself in the black sand on the beach. 

The rooms themselves are truly palatial and the bathrooms are stunning. I could not recommend this highly enough for a grown family or a group of friends.

    <ROverallComments>Taman Ahimsa was one of the best accommodations we've ever stayed at. We got married there and stayed with our wedding party. The place is beautiful and has a lovely bali charm.  The pool looking out onto the ocean is breathtaking. The living area was spacious and comfortable.  
We were impressed with the following
 - the pest control - there was a serious lack of mosquitos, even in the outdoor bathrooms
 - the staff was amazing. They were able to accommodate everything - arranging drivers, massages, manicures in addition to our requests related to the wedding. 
 - The chef - the food was delicious.  
 - The turn down service in the evening, attention to details
 - On the night of our wedding, we got an extra special turn down service with rose petals on the bed and rose petals which spelled out our initials in the bath.  

It is in Cemagi, rural Bali with not much else around.  You definitely need a driver if you want to go somewhere.  The closest tourist attraction would be Tanah Lot.  I would definitely stay here again for a getaway (not to explore Bali) - and so much fun to be able to stay with 6 other couples or a large family.   </ROverallComments>

The views are incredible and the pool superb. We loved every aspect of our stay. Definitely a place to come to for special event. Thank you all. We will long remember you.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We decided to book the whole 7 bedrooms villa and it was amazing. Staying here not only gives us a sense of Bali that other places gives but an additional "traditional" feeling. The finishing touch on the place would be the people. The courtesies, always helping to provide for us, the best stay in our lives. I'd like to thank to Ms Prama, Mirah, Edi for all the smiles, service and help during our stay. This is a wonderful place and we are sure to return.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Taman Ahimsa is a dream! We had wonderful high expectations but this place rose above and beyond! All twelve of us fell in love with Taman Ahimsa. The food, staff, scenery and facilities are all outstanding. Most importantly, Taman Ahimsa created the perfect back drop for our wedding. It was beautiful beyond words. The staffs including Prama, were so kind and professionally warm. Thank you for helping create life long memories. We will never forget our stay here. Thank you again for all your extraordinary hospitality.</ROverallComments>

The grounds, staff, furniture, rooms, outlook and vibe was so serene, relaxing and enjoyable. We wouldn't have asked for a more amazing location to spend our special day with family and friends.

We have been honored to spend our wedding day here together with our Italian and Kazakh families. Thank you very much for the incredible service and never ending patience. We were amazed with the endless vegetarian menus, a prefect match for an eco and sustainable villa like Taman Ahimsa, a truly peaceful garden.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We were a group of 14 people with children , had excellent time in the villa. the staff  was extremely attentive to our needs , food prepared by the chef was excellent.  overall was great place with excellent location . Would give 11/10 marks to the staff for there service and hospitality. We forgot some money in the room on our departure and Ida was kind enough to travel to the airport to handover the money which was very nice and caring about her.

    <ROverallComments>The perfect location for our wedding and family vacation. The rooms, service, food and atmosphere were amazing and the staff extremely friendly and attentive. Prama, Edi, Ayu and the team made sure we felt welcome and comfortable. We leave here very relaxed with smiles on our faces, fat bellies and incredible memories. We will be back to celebrate an anniversary soon.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Took two years worth of planning 6 flights, 16 people, 5 years of saving and tons of organization to get to where we are today. My wife (newly weds) found Taman Ahimsa in 2014, we loved the idea of having our wedding in Bali. We paid a visit to the villa and instantly become enamored by the 'feel', the architecture, the beach and fine details. Although getting here proved to be challenging, once we got here we were living it up. Perhaps this place is a close to paradise as we will ever come close to. For those looking for a sign that "Taman Ahimsa" is for you. Then look no further. Truth, beauty and all the great things in life is right in front of you. Special thanks to all of the Taman Ahimsa staff and Elite Havens. May we meet again.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We are extremely delighted to choose this villa for our family's vacation to Bali. We cannot express our satisfaction and joy in words about our stay at one of your magnificent villas at Cemagi. This is only possible because of your very kind and cooperative staff and manager. All of them were always smiling and have taken care of our stay. It has been one of the most memorable holidays at your prestigious property. We will recommended this property to our friends and associates back in Mumbai, India. Also, we may come again to experience your hospitality too. Keep it up with same quality.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>A totally beautiful place to have our wedding. When you arrive it's like " WOW" from the entrance you walk in to the beach front. Rooms were amazing which gives the relaxation feel when you step in.
Staff, all of them so friendly, helpful, caring looked after all of us perfectly. Would totally recommended Taman Ahimsa for any occasion.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>My family and I had an amazing time at Taman Ahimsa Villa. The staff are incredibly friendly and very professional. The property, its interior and design is very warm and welcoming. It feels like being home while on vacation. I wish all of my vacation were similar to the experience we had here. All of our requests from organizing flowers, local artist, buying phone cards or planing tours were arranged by the management. we would gladly come back to this villa in the future. Most of all the most important aspect of the villa is the sincere thoughtfulness of the staff. We wish you all peace and prosperity for many years to come. Thank you for such an amazing experience.</ROverallComments>

The team here is amazing with their “can do” attitude.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>When we booked Taman Ahimsa for our wedding, we knew it would be beautiful. What we didn't expect was the "WOW" factor this place has walking in. Guest came from 16 different countries and we loved seeing everyone faces as they arrived and had the same reaction. The party was a lot of fun but what we really appreciated were the quiet moments with family before and after the wedding. Thank you for making this extra special.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>What a truly beautiful paradise! The villa has been a fun and special retreat and place to celebrate our daughters 16th Birthday! The staff have been wonderful and helpful, we appreciate you all. We also appreciate our driver who was kind enough to show us all around Bali and laugh at all crazy car rides. We especially loved Ayu our butler and her kindness and friendship with our daughter. She is a very special and wonderful person. Thank you so much and hope to see you again soon.</ROverallComments>

Flying over from US, Taiwan and France they were surprised and astonished by the beauty and the vibe of this villa. Our wedding is definitely one of a kind which is something that people can only dream of. Thanks to Taman Ahimsa with all the great little details - the perfect ocean view and wonderful setting. Could not ask for more, truly a paradise for all of us.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We can not say enough about what an incredible place Taman Ahimsa is and what an amazing experience the last few days have been. From the tranquility of the environment, to the beauty of the villa, to the amazing and hospitable staff - we could not have asked for a better vacation. Every morning we were greeted with smiles and enjoyed a delicious breakfast - such a great way to start each day. The staff would then help us with anything for the rest of the day - arranging massages, just making each minute of our time truly enjoyable. Everything was so clean and of such high standards - there was not one thing we could find fault in. We could recommended Taman Ahimsa to all of our family and friends, and we can't wait for our next trip back. A special heartfelt thank you to Prama and Eddy for everything you have done to make this an unforgettable trip. Thank you to all the staff for their warmth and kindness. We will take this amazing experience and keep it in our hearts.

    <ROverallComments>We had a beautiful time with lovely people who took care of us. Music instruments to play, gardens, paintings and food that we loved. Bali culture is very special and shall travel with us until the next time we come here. We are already planning. Thrilled with the village, our baby children playing with the staff a long the way. I loved the experience.
