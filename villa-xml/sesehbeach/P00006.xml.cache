      <Description><![CDATA[The family friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want.&nbsp; Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is a real plus – and one that means parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday too. <br /><br />Seseh Beach Villa II has been designed very much with children in mind.&nbsp; A children’s swimming pool, pool toys, electronic games and a special bunkroom with four beds are provided, as well as one room with a king-bed that converts to twins so kids of all ages can be accommodated.<br /><br />The team of friendly staff at Seseh Beach Villa II will make children feel as welcome as adults, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost). <br /><br />Although the equipped kitchen allows you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will be happy to do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest. Pancakes by the pool for breakfast? Toasties for tea? No problem. The chef can customise all meals to suit children’s taste buds. <br /><br />Don’t worry about packing all that cumbersome kids’ equipment for your stay. Just let us know what you need, and anything we don’t have in-house (villa facilities include a baby cot, highchair, car seat and games) we can hire on your behalf (click <a title="Children's equipment - Elite Havens" target="_blank" href="http://cdn.elitehavens.com/docs/misc/eh_children_equipment.pdf">here</a> to see list of available hire items).<br /><br />And when the excitement of exploring the villa starts to wear off, check out our <a title="Seseh Beach Villas - things to do" target="_self" href="../the-locale/things-to-do.html">Things to do</a> page – there’s plenty in the area to keep all the family amused throughout the holiday.]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[The Seseh Beach Villas’ manager will have a wealth of information about nearby places of interest and will help arrange transport and make any bookings required.&nbsp; Do also ask the staff about the local area.&nbsp; Many of them live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.<br /><br />In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.<br /><br /><ol><li>The villa is close to the famous temple at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tanah Lot</span>, although in peak season a few too many tourists may transform a sunset visit into more of a heaving photo opportunity than a moving experience.&nbsp; Visiting early in the morning (8-9am) provides a better idea of the power of the location and the chance to see it undisturbed apart from perhaps an offering ceremony.</li><li>A nice sunset alternative is to head down to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Echo Beach</span> where a number of cafes offer good sunset views and cold beer.&nbsp; Note that the beach here is dark sand and the waters are better suited to surfing, having a pronounced swell and rip, rather than children’s swimming.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hotel Tugu</span>, a very stylish and eclectic boutique hotel a few minutes further down the coast is also a good sunset spot.</li><li>Fashionistas, trendies and shop-a-holics should hot-foot it down to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Seminyak</span>, Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave.&nbsp; Here, you can indulge for hours in the glut of stylish, chic boutiques.&nbsp; There is a wide choice of fine dining, mid range, and cheap ‘n cheerful restaurants in Seminyak too:&nbsp; fine dining venues include Sarong, the famous Ku Dé Ta, Mama San, La Lucciola, Merah Putih, Sardine and Métis.</li><li>Drive westwards to explore the charming <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabanan regency</span>, revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities.&nbsp; Or head north to explore the volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul, including Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu – one of Bali’s most important temples.</li><li>The most exclusive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali trekking tour</span> promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href=" http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title="Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. ">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. </a><br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali Treetop Adventure Park</span> is near the town of Bedugal in northern central Bali (next to Lake Bratan).&nbsp; Five adventure circuits, with heights ranging from two to 20 metres, challenge all level and ages on suspended bridges, spider nets, Tarzan jumps and 12 flying foxes.</li><li>Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and rural villages; a great way to <span style="font-weight: bold;">get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali</span>.&nbsp; Stop off at a local <span style="font-style: italic;">warung </span>(café) to sample some basic Balinese fare or cool off with a cold drink.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ol>]]></Description>
