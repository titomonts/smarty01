    <RHighlight>Aside from the great facilities and comforts and service that this villa provides, Seseh village is also a beautiful place to explore.&nbsp; A stay here provides a very comfortable insight into the traditions of the real Bali.<br /></RHighlight>

    <ROverallComments>We had a great stay in Seseh Beach Villa II and found everything to be nigh on perfect with all the modern comforts of home mixed with all the lazy pleasures of a tropical holiday.&nbsp; It was incredibly peaceful and quiet with lots of sunshine and swimming by day, while by night we enjoyed big-screen movie sessions, long leisurely dinners and the sounds of the waves lulling us to sleep in our super-soft beds. <br /><br />After spending much of the day beside the pool, sunset proved to be the best time to head down to the beach for a wander along the sands and a paddle in the surf.&nbsp; There are no lifeguards here and the water can be a bit rough, so swimming is not recommended.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />In the evenings, it was fun to gather around our own private bar for a pre-dinner drink.&nbsp; The chef here is a very talented man, and the Balinese and Indonesian specialties that came out of his kitchen were superb.&nbsp; Getting out of our incredibly comfortable bed in the morning was made easy in the knowledge that a hearty breakfast would soon be on the table.<br /></ROverallComments>
    <RUnpleasantSurprise>While Seseh Beach Villa II is lovely in its own right, with a beautiful design and all creature comforts and top class staff and facilities, it is really at its best when rented in conjunction with its beachfront sister villa so that guests can truly appreciate the sea views and absolute proximity to the ocean.&nbsp; That said, itâ€™s still only 100 metres from the waves.<br /></RUnpleasantSurprise>
