      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Seseh Beach Villa is located moments from the ocean in a traditional village that has a very strong sense of community and still retains the customs and culture of old Bali. There are no sophisticated facilities in the area, so local activities are limited to walks on the beach (it’s not very safe for swimming), or gentle hikes through the glorious rice fields. Alternatively, you can join in with some of the village activities, watch the temple processions, or befriend the staff and get invited to ceremonies. However, with the services of the villa’s complimentary car and driver, Bali’s many cultural, natural, gastronomic and retail delights are all within easy reach.</p>]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[<p>Seseh Beach Villa’s manager will have a wealth of information about  nearby places of interest and will help arrange extra transport or make  any bookings required. Do also ask the staff about the local area. Many  of them live nearby and will be able to give an interesting insight into  some of the fascinating aspects of Bali life.</p> <p>In the meantime, here is a taste of the many and varied activities on offer within reach of the villa.</p> <ol><li>The villa is close to the famous temple at <strong>Tanah Lot</strong>,  although in peak season a few too many tourists may transform a sunset  visit into more of a heaving photo opportunity than a moving experience.  Visiting early in the morning (8-9am) provides a better idea of the  power of the location and the chance to see it undisturbed apart from  perhaps an offering ceremony.</li><li>A nice sunset alternative is to head down to <strong>Echo Beach</strong>  where a number of cafes offer good sunset views and cold beer. Note  that the beach here is dark sand and the waters are better suited to  surfing, having a pronounced swell and rip, rather than children’s  swimming. <strong>Hotel Tugu</strong>, a very stylish and eclectic boutique hotel a few minutes further down the coast is also a good sunset spot.</li><li>Fashionistas, trendies and shop-a-holics should hot-foot it down to <strong>Seminyak</strong>,  Bali’s most cosmopolitan enclave. Here, you can indulge for hours in  the glut of stylish, chic boutiques. There is a wide choice of fine  dining, mid range, and cheap ‘n cheerful restaurants in Seminyak too:  fine dining venues include Sarong, the famous Ku Dé Ta, Mama San, La  Lucciola, MerahPutih, Sardine and Métis.</li><li>Drive westwards to explore the charming <strong>Tabanan regency</strong>,  revealing terraced rice fields of emerald green, volcanic mountains and  black-sand beaches dotted with fishing communities. Or head north to  explore the volcanic lakes near the mountain town of Bedugul, including  Lake Bratan with its photogenic and stunningly positioned Pura Ulun Danu  – one of Bali’s most important temples.</li><li>The most exclusive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bali trekking tour</span> promises breath-taking vistas and heart-warming encounters while supporting sustainable social change in the once-forgotten villages of Muntigunung. Elite Havens is a proud partner of <a href=" http://www.magazine.elitehavens.com/private-bali-trek-muntigunung/" target="_blank" title="Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. ">Muntigunung Community Social Enterprise. </a><br /></li><li><strong>Bali Treetop Adventure Park</strong> is near the town of  Bedugal in northern central Bali (next to Lake Bratan). Five adventure  circuits, with heights ranging from two to 20 metres, challenge all  level and ages on suspended bridges, spider nets, Tarzan jumps and 12  flying foxes.</li><li>Explore the scenic rice-field landscape and rural villages; a great way to <strong>get under the skin of the ‘real’ Bali</strong>. Stop off at a local <em>warung</em> (café) to sample some basic Balinese fare or cool off with a cold drink.</li><li>Covering 3.8 hectares of tropical parkland in Kuta, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterbom </span>Bali has 16 water slides (including The Climax with its 360 degree loop) to entertain the young and the young at heart. A great family day out, but go early to beat the crowds.<br /><br /></li></ol>]]></Description>
