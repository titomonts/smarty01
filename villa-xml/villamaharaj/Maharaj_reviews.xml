	Location, location, swimming pool. The MahaRaj swimming pool is delightful and given the garden is a real suntrap; the hanging frangipani trees give great shade. To be able to step out of the villa and be at the beach within five minutes or, in a few more steps, be at the heart of the shopping area, is a real treat. We did fight over the hammock!</p>
</RHighlight>
    <RSurroundArea><p>
	There is really no need for a car if you are staying at the MahaRaj as virtually everything you might need is within walking distance. The beach is just 500m away &ndash; note the beach is fine but this is a surfers&rsquo; coast so the rips and currents can be very strong. A good many of the iconic restaurants of Bali are in easy reach &ndash; La Lucciola, Ku De Ta, Sarong, The Living Room to name but a few. There are also many more low key places. At the end of the road is The Works &ndash; a popular spa which is probably a cheaper option than the villas contracted spa. In the other direction Grocer &amp; Grind is a good bistro and deli for provisioning &ndash; although we were happy to leave this to the chef.</p>

	A true oasis right in the centre of Seminyak. The MahaRaj is surprisingly quiet given its central location &ndash; partly because it is down a very quiet cul-de-sac and partly because of the high walls. What is nice though is you do not feel walled in as the villa has been laid out well to give maximum space to the swimming pool and lawns but also the gardens are wonderfully mature covering most of the walls with foliage and flowers.<br />
	<br />
	This is a great hideaway for a family or a small group wanting to have a peaceful location right in the centre of the action. The bedrooms themselves are not luxurious &ndash; comfortable but very simply furnished. That said, the living areas (where we spent most of our time) are eminently comfortable. The staff could not have been more helpful. The food was excellent as was the service.<br />
	<br />
	The owners of MahaRaj must be listeners as well as doers for on our return we found that the kitchen &ndash; oft-neglected-by-guests (who predominantly use the chef&rsquo;s services) had been moved out to the back and the space has been turned into an air-conditioned TV room. The garden guest house has also been modified from having an open shared bathroom to two separate bathrooms. Maintenance has also been kept at the highest level and MahaRaj is still a delight to behold.</p>
</ROverallComments>
    <RUnpleasantSurprise><p>
	We were slightly disappointed with the bedrooms which were rather sparsely furnished. The beds themselves were eminently comfortable we just felt the rooms would benefit from a little more furniture, maybe a rug to cover the rather basic marble tile floor and some of the wonderful art that Bali has to offer. In contrast the living areas are nicely decked out and in truth this where you will spend most of your time.</p>

    <ROverallComments>Our stay at the Maharaj was superb. It looks better in real life than the pictures! We will stay there again next time we are in Bali.

    <ROverallComments>Great location, walk out the door and you are in Seminyak. Nice pleasant oasis within the bustle of the area. Highlight for me has to be the pool - so inviting. And the super friendly staff, the fact we were late and they rang our driver to check we were ok was a lovely touch.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments> My family did not cease to be impressed from the time we passed through the gate. Everything necessary for a luxurious relaxing vacation is at hand. We had no problems with any of the services everything worked reliably even the Wi-Fi connect was good for Bali. The spacious rooms were kept spotless as was the garden, kitchen and living areas.the spacious pool was well used as was the sun deck.

The staffs were extraordinary with the younger members of our family to the extent of playing games with them, our efforts to speak Indonesian were reciprocated with enthusiasm and the children delighted in their conversations which expanded their Indonesian vocabulary.
We have subjected to first class service while our privacy was respected and at no time did we feel neglected or overpower with attention. 
We invited some guests to lunch on two occasions and asked the staff for suggestion for on Indonesian meal, the effort the staff made and the meal provided was the best meal of our vacation.
I would rate the MahRaj and all its facilities as really good but the staff was 5 star and contributed greatly to our enjoyment of all the villa has to offer.

    <ROverallComments>The MahaRaj would have to be the best Villa to stay in Seminyak. We(all 7 of us) had so much room it was pure luxury! The pool is the best private pool in Seminyak! We cant say enough positive things about the gorgeous staff and cant name them out separately as they all had a huge positive impact on us. The food and service was high end and we recommend to use their amazing chefs services.I have to say I was a Queen for a week and miss the place terribly now we are back at home!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>A warm welcome from the Villa Manager was a very good prelude to a worry-free stay.  The Staff were very accommodating and they were always at their toes at one call.  

The Villa is lovely and spacious! How can anyone even complain about the master bedroom having direct views of the pool and lawn? The master suite is a bit too big and empty though... and I think a bigger bed could've filled up some of the space but the luxurious bathroom compensates for it.  An option for brighter lights in the bathroom will make it perfect (I find it difficult to see myself in the mirror under dim lights).  The other rooms are equally great and comfy...

It was a good stay... the pool was lovely!</ROverallComments>

Out the door and into Seminyak, great that the street the villa is just off is thriving with restaurants now. New TV room added since my last visit which is a real plus. Looking for an retreat in Seminyak.... perfect.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We went to Bali again for a family wedding and we stayed at the Maharaj. From the minute we arrived the staff were amazing greeting us with cold facewashers, food and drinks after our flight. The service was excellent as was the amazing meals they cooked for us (thoroughly recommended). The grounds and the pool were immaculate but for us the location was perfect as we know this area well and we all feel comfortable heading off wherever whenever on our own. Thoroughly recommend for a large group of people. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Our family stay at The Maha Raj Villa in January 2015 was outstanding. The family included my son and his wife, my daughter her husband and my 2 year old grandson and myself.  I was celebrating my 60th birthday and it was one of the best holidays we have ever had.  The staff had gone out of there way to decorate the villa for my birthday.The Villa was fantastic and suited the needs of the entire family with all bedrooms having there own bathrooms and toilets .  The pool was fabulous.  The gardens are so well maintained and it makes a perfect setting to relax and enjoy the Bali lifestyle.  The Villa is in a great location in Seminyak and off the main road but still accessible to restaurants and a short stroll to the beach and Seminyak Square -it is so quiet although surrounded by other villas but also very private with no other properties looking into the villa. The staff were great -nothing was a problem.  They looked after us like royalty and were all so friendly and caring.  We all felt like part of the Villa Maha Raj family!!  We would all highly recommend this Villa and look forward to another stay there in the coming years.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>A very pleasant villa, ideally suited to our family.  The staff were very accommodating and attentive. The power failures were not a problem as the gen-set was quickly started and no problems were encountered. 
I loved it. The pool and garden is delightful and the squirrels in the frangipani trees were endless source of amusement. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Gorgeous Villa, just perfect for a family holiday. We did not feel like leaving.
The staff were lovely, although we did have a few communication issues, they were happy to help us whenever they could.
The house and garden are really well kept and the rooms and bathrooms were fabulous. 

Lots of mossies around so take lots of Mossie spray.

    <ROverallComments>The villa was beautiful. The staff were excellent. I would strongly recommend that for great service Villa Maharaj is the place to stay.
Only drawback is that construction is taking place in the neighbouring property. A lot of noise and dust is generated.
You need to ensure privacy of the villa is not lost when the building next door comes up.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>The villa is superb and in a fantastic location. It offers luxurious accommodation, with a huge pool and indoor/outdoor entertainment area. The unexpected addition of an air-conditioned TV room was also fabulous. The meals cooked by Sulena were outstanding and nothing was too much trouble for Arya and the other staff. The staff were also all very lovely towards our two young children. They are a great team and deserve high praise.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Our Stay at the villa was enhanced by the extremely attentive staff. They thought of everything - even anticipating our needs before we knew we had them. The villas garden and pool were our own little private sanctuary in Seminyak. While we had same incredible meals out in restaurants while here, some of our best meals were served here in the villa. We will always think well of our time here. Beautiful place, beautiful staff!! Many thanks.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>This has been the most perfect holiday imaginable for all of us. Maharaj Villa is well designed and we enjoyed all aspects of its lay out. The pool was our central focus - always kept clean! What made our stay so relaxing and special - was the amazing attention by very lovely and friendly staff. We felt like royalty. Nothing was too much effort. Meals were amazing! Compliments to the chef. Food was always fresh, tasty and made to suit our needs. And our grandson Jackson - received so much attention from all the gentle staff. He loved the fun they shared with him. We appreciated the beautiful garden and its impeccable upkeep. Not to mention the cleanliness of our rooms.
All in all - we are all leaving smiling - with wonderful memories of Villa Maharaj and its very dedicated staff. THANK YOU!!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Thank you for making our stay in Bali truly memorable. We loved staying at The Maharaj. The pool and surrounds were beautiful. The cooking was fabulous and our needs for different meals were always attended to. Baby Ella loved the attention you all gave her, the photo's we have will be treasured. It will be sad leaving this beautiful villa, fab weather and lovely Bali.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Firstly we thank you for a lovely holiday at Villa Maharaj. We really enjoyed the lovely rooms, beautiful pool, grounds & surrounds. All the staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for looking after all the boys so the adults could go out for dinner! Thank you for the great food and catering to some peculiar 4 & 7 year old requests. Our children loved the food and always wanted to eat here. It has been a very relaxing holiday for us and we look forward to our next trip. Thank you!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>We spent an astonishing moment here at The Maharaj. Of course, the villa is wonderful and the equipment/ amenities are splendid but I believe the real jewel of this stay remains the staff, always helpful, lovely and nice. We want to thank every member of the staff for their professionalism and their kindness. It is rare to have the luck to meet so lovely people. All the best and thanks again for all of your help, smile and friendship.</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Thank you so much for making our stay so enjoyable and relaxing. Adi did a fantastic job of ensuring all our request were met. All the staff made us feel so welcome and looking after us seemed a pleasure. It was wonderful to see all their smiling faces each day and to enjoy having conversations on a personal level. Being able to stay in a lovely villa was very nice but the staff certainly made our stay a very memorable one. Great villa, great staff, great location! We also think the best villa breakfast we have had over the years staying in villas in Phuket, Lombok, Bali, and Koh Samui. Thanks again!</ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>Adi, Illo, Putra and the entire staff of the wonderful Maharaj let me take the time to thank you for making our stay in Bali the most memorable and enjoyable holiday we have had in many years. Your hospitality warmth really made The Maharaj a home away from home. As far as the staff is concerned I can suggest nothing that could be improved, if anything it would be nice to have a little more light. However, apart from that all i can say is a heartfelt thank you on behalf of anyone in our family for helping us create memories that will last lifetime. </ROverallComments>

    <ROverallComments>It was a pleasure staying at The Maharaj. We enjoyed the hospitality of the entire team - Adi, Illo, and Putra in particular were excellent. We would recommend this place to others and would also love to come back again. Enjoyable stay, superb service, will return. Simply lovely. </ROverallComments>
