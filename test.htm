We got married there and stayed with our wedding party. The place is beautiful and has a lovely bali charm. The pool looking out onto the ocean is breathtaking. The living area was spacious and comfortable. We were impressed with the following - the pest control - there was a serious lack of mosquitos, even in the outdoor bathrooms - the staff was amazing. They were able to accommodate everything - arranging drivers, massages, manicures in addition to our requests related to the wedding. - The chef - the food was delicious. - The turn down service in the evening, attention to details - On the night of our wedding, we got an extra special turn down service with rose petals on the bed and rose petals which spelled out our initials in the bath. It is in Cemagi, rural Bali with not much else around. You definitely need a driver if you want to go somewhere. The closest tourist attraction would be Tanah Lot. I would definitely stay here again for a getaway (not to explore Bali) - and so much fun to be able to stay with 6 other couples or a large family. </p><p class="gr-name">Mike T, </p></div></li><li class="gsrev"><div class="right" style="text-align:center"><p class="gr-date">September 27th, 2013 - October 2nd, 2013</p><p>We had the pleasure of staying at Taman Ahimsa and holding our wedding within the grouds.

It may be my favourite place on the planet, particularly because of the delightful staff led by Prahma. I celebrated my 30th birthday here with eight friends and family and though we had made a number of plans to explore the area, aside from a sunset visit to Tanah Lot (great for holiday snaps) and two dinners out, we did not leave. Get the yoga teachers and masseuses to come to you and kick back by the pool, on the day beds, and bury yourself in the black sand on the beach. The rooms themselves are truly palatial and the bathrooms are stunning. I could not recommend this highly enough for a grown family or a group of friends. </p><p class="gr-name">David E, Australia</p></div></li><li class="gsrev"><div class="right" style="text-align:center"><p class="gr-date">June 5th, 2013 - June 11th, 2013</p><p>The exact location of the villa is somewhat difficult for taxi drivers to locate especially if you arrive in the evening. The villa itself is extremely beautiful and a great retreat especially if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life and looking for a place to unwind in tranquility. The view from the pool of the beach is breathtaking. The rooms are spacious with a modern yet rural feel. The staff are friendly and cater to your needs. The location is far from Kuta and Seminyak so you will need to use a driver if you want to do shopping but this place is a perfect stay as you can order in and enjoy the facilities the villa has to offer.</p><p class="gr-name">Shabana none, Zambia</p></div></li><li class="gsrev"><div class="right" style="text-align:center"><p class="gr-date">May 17th, 2013 - May 20th, 2013</p><p>Very happy with the experience in Taman Ahimsa.

The grounds are stunning, and the oceanfront views cannot be beat. Each night we feel asleep to the crashing waves. What an experience! And the staff here are truly the best! Thank you for truly making our stay wonderful and for going above and beyond. We will never forget out stay and experience at Taman Ahimsa! Great for larger groups, couples, and families!</p><p class="gr-name">jack C, United States</p></div></li><li class="gsrev"><div class="right" style="text-align:center"><p class="gr-date">February 26th, 2013 - February 28th, 2013</p><p>This place is good and in a good quite location. The swimming pool is very big and the open layout nice. Service was very good and the staffs were very helpful. My mother and I love Balinese open style design, so The Ahimsa Villa is perfect. The Ahimsa provides a transfer service, which we used were really helps us to solve all the traveling problems.</p><p class="gr-name">Teong Siew Meng, Zambia</p></div></li></ul>
